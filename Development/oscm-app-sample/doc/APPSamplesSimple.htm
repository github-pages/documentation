    <h1 class="topictitle1">GettingStarted Sample</h1>

    <div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The GettingStarted sample is a simple implementation of a service controller based on the Application Provisioning Platform (APP).</p>

            <p>The sample shows how the methods of a service controller could be implemented using the automatic polling mechanisms of APP. For this purpose, the service controller does not require a real application. It just manages the instance status by means of a dispatcher and sends information emails. For details, refer to the documentation in the source code.</p>

            <p>The source code as well as additional resources are contained in the <samp class="codeph">oscm-app-sampleSRC.zip</samp> file.</p>

            <p>You can deploy and use the sample service controller for testing and practicing purposes in a working APP environment. Proceed as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="liexpand">Using the standard utilities of the application server (administration console), add the service controller archive to the domain of APP (<samp class="codeph">app-domain</samp>). <p>You can use the <samp class="codeph">oscm-app-sample.ear</samp> archive shipped with the sample or build your own archive from the source code. </p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Register the service controller in APP for your organization and enter the required configuration settings in the APP database.<p>To do this, you can execute the SQL statements in the following file, which is included in the <samp class="codeph">oscm-app-sampleSRC.zip</samp>:</p>
<p><samp class="codeph">resources\appconfiguration.sql</samp></p>
<p>Before executing the SQL statements, replace <samp class="codeph">&lt;ORGANIZATION_ID&gt;</samp> with the ID of your organization in <span>OSCM</span>. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can register the service controller at the Web interface of APP or enter the settings in the APP database by means of a standard table editor.</p>
<p>In any case, connect to the database with the user ID and password specified for the database access in the <samp class="codeph">db.properties</samp> file when configuring APP.</p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Create a technical service and import it in <span>OSCM</span>.<p>As a basis and for details on required parameters and settings, use the technical service definition which is included in the <samp class="codeph">oscm-app-sampleSRC.zip</samp>:</p>
<p><samp class="codeph">resources\TechnicalService.xml</samp></p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Define one or more marketable services based on the technical service and publish them to a marketplace. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">Create, manage, and delete subscriptions to see how the service controller works. </li>

            </ol>
