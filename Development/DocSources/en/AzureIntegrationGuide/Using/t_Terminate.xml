    <title>Terminating Subscriptions</title>

        <context>
            <p>A customer can at any time terminate a subscription for resources in Azure.</p>
            <p>Azure Resource Manager is triggered to delete all the resources created for the subscription, i.e. the virtual machines and, depending on the service, the storage account or resource group. The subscription is terminated in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> independent of whether the deletion in Azure is successful. Note, however, that the subscription name cannot be re-used before the deletion has been completed in Azure.</p>
