    <title>Executing Service Operations</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Customers can explicitly start and stop the virtual machines created for a specific subscription in Azure from <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />. To do this, they execute the appropriate service operation at the subscription:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Start</b>: Starts all virtual machines created for the subscription if they were stopped.</li>
                <li><b>Stop</b>: Stops all virtual machines created for the subscription if they were started.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a prerequisite, the service operations must be defined in the technical service underlying the subscription.</p>
            <p>Customers can view the status of all operations they started in their account information on the <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> marketplace.</p>
