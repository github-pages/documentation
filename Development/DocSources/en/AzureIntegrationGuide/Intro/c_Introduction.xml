      <p>Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. Apart from Software as a Service and Platform as a Service, it provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) according to your needs and allows you to quickly scale these capacities as your requirements change.</p>
