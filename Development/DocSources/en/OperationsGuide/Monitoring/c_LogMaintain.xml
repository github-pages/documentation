    <title>Maintaining the Log Files</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>New messages are continually appended to the log files at runtime. When a file reaches a size of 10 MB, a new one is created; the number 1 is appended to the old one. When the second log file reaches 10 MB in size, the number 2 is appended to it, and a third log file is created. When the maximum number of 5 log files is reached, the first one is overwritten. </p>
            <p>It is recommended to check the log files and their sizes from time to time and to create a backup when you see that the maximum number of files will be reached. </p>
