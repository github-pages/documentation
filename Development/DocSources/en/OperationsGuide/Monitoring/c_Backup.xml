            <p>It is recommended to create a regular backup of the following data:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            /> database (<codeph>bss</codeph>). The frequency of database backups depends on the amount of changes and on the availability of time slots with low load. PostgreSQL supports database backups without previous shutdown. For details, refer to the PostgreSQL documentation. </li>
                    <li>Certificates (<codeph>keystore.jks</codeph> and <codeph>cacerts.jks</codeph> files). </li>
                    <li><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        /> log files located in the configured directory. ###???</li>
