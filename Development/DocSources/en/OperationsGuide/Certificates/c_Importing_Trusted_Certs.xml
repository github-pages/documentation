  <title>Importing Trusted SSL Certificates</title>
  <conbody>
    <section>If you want your application to trust certain, possibly self-signed SSL certificates, put them in PEM format in the following directory on your Docker host: <p><codeph>/docker/config/certs</codeph></p><p>Replace <codeph>/docker</codeph> with the directory where Docker is installed.</p>The <codeph>/docker/config/certs</codeph> directory is shared by all containers. By default, if you use your own SSL key pairs, you must also place all the public certificate files here. </section>
