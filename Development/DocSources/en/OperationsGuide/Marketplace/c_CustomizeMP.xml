    <title>Customizing the Layout of Marketplaces</title>
    <conbody>
        <section>
            <p>After deployment, <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> provides a neutral branding for marketplaces. Marketplace owners can download the source files of this branding as a <codeph>branding-package.zip</codeph> file and use this as a basis for customizing the layout and branding of their marketplaces. Once a marketplace owner is finished with any customizations, you are responsible for uploading the changes to the <codeph>oscm-branding</codeph> container. </p>
            <p>To upload and deploy a customized branding, proceed as follows: </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to the Docker host as user root. </li>
                    <li>Extract the archive file provided by the marketplace owner (<codeph>&lt;folder-name>.zip</codeph> file) to the following folder on your Docker host: <p><codeph>/docker/config/oscm-branding/brandings/</codeph></p></li>
                    <li>Provide the URL pointing to the customized files to the respective marketplace owner. <p>By default, the URL is as follows: </p><p><codeph>https://&lt;hostname.fqdn>:8443/&lt;new-folder-name>/css/mp.css</codeph></p>where <codeph>&lt;hostname.fqdn></codeph> is the name and the fully qualified domain name of the host used to access <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />, and <codeph>&lt;new-folder-name></codeph> is the name of the folder containing the customized files. </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </section>
    </conbody>
