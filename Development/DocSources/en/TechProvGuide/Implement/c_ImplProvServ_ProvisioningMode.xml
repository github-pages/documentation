  <title>Provisioning Mode</title>
  <conbody>
        <p>Instance provisioning can be performed in synchronous or asynchronous mode.</p>
        <section><title>Synchronous Mode</title>This mode is used if provisioning can be completed right away. The provisioning service triggers the application to perform all the required actions and confirms the operation as complete. <ph
                conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
            /> then sets the subscription to active, which means that the service is ready to be used by the customer.  </section>
        <section>
            <title>Asynchronous Mode</title>
            <p>This mode is used if provisioning operations take a long time because long-running processes or manual steps are involved, or when huge amounts of data or virtual machines need to be set up. In this case, the provisioning service notifies <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> that the provisioning is pending. Required actions may have started on the application side, but have not been completed yet. The provisioning service needs to notify <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> using the subscription management service when provisioning is either complete or cannot be completed. </p>
            <p><ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> supports the development of asynchronous provisioning services with the asynchronous provisioning platform (APP). This is a framework which provides a provisioning service as well as functions, data persistence, and notification features which are always required for integrating applications in asynchronous mode. Refer to <xref
                    href="../Reference/c_APP.xml"/> for details on APP.</p>
