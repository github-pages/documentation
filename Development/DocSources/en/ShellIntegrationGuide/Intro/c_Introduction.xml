                              <p>The Shell integration allows users to install any software or execute any task in a UNIX environment by running Shell scripts. </p>
      <p>When integrating applications with <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
        />, the instance provisioning can be done in two provisioning modes: synchronous or asynchronous mode.</p>
      <p>Asynchronous provisioning is required if provisioning operations take a long time because long-running processes or manual steps are involved. This is the case, for example, when provisioning virtual machines on a virtual machine server. <ph
          conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
        /> supports the integration of such applications with its asynchronous provisioning platform (APP). This is a framework which provides a provisioning service as well as functions, data persistence, and notification features which are always required for integrating applications in asynchronous mode.</p>
      <p>When deploying the <codeph>oscm-app</codeph> container provided with <ph
          conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
        />, a Shell service controller is preconfigured and registered with the asynchronous provisioning platform (APP). </p>
                              <p>This manual describes how to create and use services for Shell scripts on an <ph
          conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> marketplace. </p>
