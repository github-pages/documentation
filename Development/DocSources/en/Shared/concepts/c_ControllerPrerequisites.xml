A template defines the virtual machines as well as other resources to be deployed and the dependencies between them. For each resource manager template, a corresponding parameter definition file in JSON format must exist. It is used to pass the parameter values a user specifies at subscription time to the resource manager template. <p>The Azure integration package contains sample resource manager templates and parameter definition files. You can use these files as a basis and adapt them as required. Additional templates can be defined with the Azure Resource Manager. </p><p>The templates and parameter definition files need to be available in a location hat can be accessed from <ph
