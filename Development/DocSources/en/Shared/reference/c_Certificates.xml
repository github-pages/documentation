    <title>Integrating Certificates for Trusted Communication</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>Certificates are required for <ph conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> to allow for trusted communication between <ph
                conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> and the Asynchronous Provisioning Platform (APP), or an application underlying a technical service . <!--ph>a payment service provider (PSP), an Identity Provider (IdP) or a Security Token Service (STS).</ph--> The <ph
                conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> deployer has already created a respective directory structure and a suitable Docker Compose configuration. In this way, default certificates have been inserted into the respective containers after deployment, thus communication between <ph
                conref="../Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> and APP is secured. </p>
        <p>It is however possible to use custom SSL keypairs for the application listeners. They may be self-signed or official. Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format is mandatory. This is a container format that may include just the public certificate, or may include an entire certificate chain including public key, private key, and root certificates. It is only necessary to place the respective certificate and/or key files in PEM format into the appropriate directories.</p>
