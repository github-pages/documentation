  <title>Importing Trusted SSL Certificates</title>
  <conbody>
    <section>If you want your application to trust certain, possibly self-signed SSL certificates, put them in PEM format in the following directory on your Docker host: <p><codeph>/docker/config/certs</codeph></p><p>Replace <codeph>/docker</codeph> with the base directory on the Docker host that you use for persisting data.</p>For example, if you want to use the VMware service controller, you need to export the vSphere certificate in PEM format, and copy it to the <codeph>/docker/config/certs</codeph> directory. Since the VMware service controller is running in the <codeph>oscm-app</codeph> container, a restart of this container is required.</section>
