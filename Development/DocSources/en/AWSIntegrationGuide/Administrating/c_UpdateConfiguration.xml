            <title>Updating Service Controller Settings in the Database</title>
            <conbody>
        <section>During deployment, several configuration settings are written to the <codeph>bssapp</codeph> database. This configuration is used for the initial setup of the AWS service controller and its registration with APP. It is up to the platform operator for taking care that the initial settings are correct. <p
