    <title>Authentication Mode</title>

        <section>
            <p>Before starting to install <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />, you must decide on how users and Web services are to be authenticated. </p>
            <p>The following sections explain the supported scenarios.</p>
        </section>
        <section conref="../../Shared/concepts/c_AuthenticationMode.xml#Auth/auth_internal"/>
        <section><p>It is recommended to use the INTERNAL authentication mode if Web browser single sign-on is not required, and if your customers are to be able to register themselves. </p></section>
        <section conref="../../Shared/concepts/c_AuthenticationMode.xml#Auth/auth_saml"/>
        <section>
            <p>It is recommended to use the SAML_SP authentication mode if you want to operate <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> in a company network and use existing authentication mechanisms that support the SAML 2.0 standard. Customer self-registration is not supported in this case, and should thus be disabled.</p>

            <p><b>Required Information From the IdP</b></p>
            <p>When using <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                    /> in SAML_SP mode, additional configuration settings in <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> are necessary. For this, you require the following:</p>
            <p>
                <ul compact="no">
                    <li>A contractual relationship with the IdP operator so that the IdP can allow for Web browser SSO and secure of Web service calls using a Security Token Service (STS).</li>
                    <li>Information on the following service endpoints. Ask the IdP operator for the following information: <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For Web browser SSO: the SAML Redirect URL of the IdP as well as the URL of the single logout service endpoint.</li>
                                <li>For STS communication: STS service endpoint URL as well as the URL pointing to the MEX address (Issuer Metadata Exchange) of the STS. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p><p>In a multi-tenancy environment and when several tenants are associated with one and the same IdP, one service endpoint per tenant must be defined and communicated.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The entity ID of the IdP system. The IdP administrator can find out the ID by retrieving the federation metadata on his IdP system. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Length of the encryption key used by the IdP. </li>
                    <li>Information on whether the IdP can process <codeph>GET</codeph> or <codeph>POST</codeph> authentication requests.</li>
                    <li>For Web browser SSO: the public key certificate from the IdP. Request this certificate from the IdP operator. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p><b>Required Information by the IdP</b></p>
            <p>When using <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> in SAML_SP mode, the administrator of the IdP system that is to be used for authenticating users requires the following information so that the IdP system can be configured correctly: </p>
            <p>
                <ul compact="no">
                    <li>A unique identifier for <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                            />. The IdP uses this ID for identifying incoming authentication requests from <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/>.</li>
                    <li>The unique identifier of the default tenant as specified when installing <ph
                            conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        />. You create this ID by specifying the corresponding configuration value in the configuration settings when installing the system.</li>
                    <li>The <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                        /> signature verification certificate. The IdP system needs this certificate for handling logout requests.</li>
                </ul>
