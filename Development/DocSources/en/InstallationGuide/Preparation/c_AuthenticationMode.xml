            <p>Before starting to install <ph conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                />, you must decide on how users and Web services are to be authenticated. </p>
            <p>The following sections explain the supported scenarios.</p>
        </section>
        <section conref="../../Shared/concepts/c_AuthenticationMode.xml#Auth/auth_internal"/>
        <section><p>It is recommended to use the INTERNAL authentication mode if Web browser single sign-on is not required, and if your customers are to be able to register themselves. </p></section>
        <section conref="../../Shared/concepts/c_AuthenticationMode.xml#Auth/auth_saml"/>
        <section>
            <p>It is recommended to use the SAML_SP authentication mode if you want to operate <ph
                    conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
                /> in a company network and use existing authentication mechanisms that support the SAML 2.0 standard. Customer self-registration is not supported in this case, and should thus be disabled.</p>
