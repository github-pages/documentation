            >The search index is automatically and periodically created by the system. The search index is available for users on marketplaces to search for subscriptions or services.</p>
        <p id="concept_SearchIndex"
                >In some cases, for example, after a recovery of the database, the search index may become inconsistent. In order to make sure that the index becomes consistent again, you can either manually delete the index files and restart the respective application server domain, or use the <b>Update search index</b> menu option to explicitly re-create the search index at any time. The search index is re-built based on the current data in the database. The existing index structure is overwritten. The search index is re-created online, and you do not need to restart any application server domain. </p>
        <p>On the <uicontrol>Update search index</uicontrol> page, you can start the re-creation of the search index by clicking <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol>.</p>
