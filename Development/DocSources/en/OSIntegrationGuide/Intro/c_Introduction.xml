It is managed by the OpenStack Foundation. </p><p>OpenStack allows users to deploy virtual systems which handle different tasks for managing a cloud environment. It makes horizontal scaling easy, which means that tasks which benefit from running concurrently can easily serve users by spinning up more resources. For example, a mobile application which needs to communicate with a remote server might be able to divide the work of communicating with each user across many different resources, all communicating with one another but scaling quickly and easily as the application gains more users.</p>The integration of OpenStack with <ph
