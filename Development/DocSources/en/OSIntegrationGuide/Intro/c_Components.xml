  <title>Components Involved in the OpenStack Integration</title>

    <section>
      <p>The following picture provides an overview of the main components involved in the integration of <ph
          conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"/> and OpenStack:</p>

      <p>Heat, the orchestration component provided by OpenStack, offers template-based mechanisms for describing cloud applications. Through both an OpenStack REST API and a CloudFormation-compatible Query API, Heat provides compatibility with existing template formats. The integration of OpenStack with <ph
          conref="../../Shared/Product_Name.xml#ProductNameTopic/Product_Abbr"
        /> supports the AWS CloudFormation Template and the Heat Orchestration Template.</p>
      <p>A template enables application developers to describe and automate the deployment of infrastructure, services, and applications. Collections of resources (e.g. networks, servers, or storage) can be deployed from a single template. The template serves as an orchestration document that details everything needed to carry out the orchestration. Once instantiated, the resources are also referred to as stacks.</p>
      <p>Each APP installation supports one OpenStack service controller. This limitation can be overcome by installing APP several times to different application server domains. The need for more than one service controller may arise because multiple OpenStack accounts or technology provider organizations have to be used.</p>
