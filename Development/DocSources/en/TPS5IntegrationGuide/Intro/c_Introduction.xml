                              <p>FUJITSU Cloud IaaS Trusted Public S5 (TPS5) gives you on-demand access to a shared pool of fully configured virtual server, storage, and network resources hosted in the FUJITSU global network of data centers. The provisioning of computing resources in the Cloud allows you to rapidly scale and flex your infrastructure to support new business initiatives or roll out services. On virtual platforms, users can, for example, request specific servers and operating systems, firewalls, load balancers, middleware services, or databases. Servers can be added and removed dynamically as required.</p>
