    <title>Subscribing to Services</title>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Users of customer organizations can subscribe to the services you have created for TPS5 on the marketplace where you have published them. This results in the provisioning of a virtual platform with one or more virtual servers in TPS5, as defined in the underlying technical service.</p>
            <p>To enable the provisioning of a TPS5 instance, the customer has to enter a name for the virtual platform. The technical service may specify a prefix which is prepended to this name, as well as a pattern against which the name is checked before the provisioning operation is started. </p>
            <p>The provisioning operations are carried out in asynchronous mode. As long as the provisioning is not complete, the status of the subscription is <b>pending</b>. The status changes to <b>ready</b> as soon as the provisioning has been finished successfully. </p>
            <p>As soon as the provisioning is complete, the subscription and the virtual platform are ready to be used. The users assigned to the subscription can access the virtual servers on the virtual platform using the IP addresses and initial passwords indicated in the subscription details on the marketplace. The initial user ID for accessing the virtual servers is <codeph>Administrator</codeph> for Microsoft Windows systems, <codeph>root</codeph> for Linux systems. It is strongly recommended that the initial password is changed after the first login.</p>
            <p>
                <note>The IP addresses indicated in the subscription details are private addresses. For accessing the virtual servers, a user must start a VPN connection.</note>
