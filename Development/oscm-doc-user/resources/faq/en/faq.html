            <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/icon-a.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" />You can restrict the access to services on a marketplace by means of organizational units.
          <p>
            An organizational unit is a set of one or more users representing, for example, a department in a company, an individual project, or a single person. 
            As an organization administrator, you can create and manage organizational units and assign OU administrators to them (click <a href="#ugthree" onclick="javascript:anzeigen('infoug3')">here</a> for details). You can define which marketable services are visible to the members of a unit.</p>
            
            <p>Here is how:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Log in as an organization administrator.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Account</b> in the top bar.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Users & Units</b> on the left side.</li>
            <li>On the <b>Organizational units</b> tab, click <b>Add Unit</b> to define a new unit, or click <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/edit.png"
                      width="20" height="20" alt="" /> to edit an existing unit.</li>
            <li>Check the services that are to be visible to the members of the unit.</li>
            </ol> 
            
            <p>OU administrators can further restrict the list of services made available to their organizational units by the organization administrator. Here is how:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Log in as an OU administrator.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Account</b> in the top bar.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Organizational units</b> on the left side.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Organizational units</b> table, click <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/edit.png"
                      width="20" height="20" alt="" /> to edit an existing unit.</li>
            <li>Check the services that are to be visible to the members of the unit.</li>
            </ol> 
			<p>Be aware of the following:</p>
			<p>As an organization administrator, OU administrator, or subscription manager, you can upgrade or downgrade subscriptions. If you do so, make sure that 
			all services that are involved in an up/downgrade path are accessible in the same organizational unit. The available services are defined by the supplier.</p>

            <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/icon-a.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" />The reason may be 
            that searchable content exists in different languages. The default language is English. 
            You can search for terms and phrases either in the language you have selected or in the default language. If you 
            combine search terms of the default language and your selected language in the same search phrase, the service cannot 
            be found. This means, that you should always use search terms of one language only.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example</b>: The English name of a service is "Highlander", there is no specific German name. The short description,
            "Kurzbeschreibung", only exists in German, there is no English short description. If you search for the
            service with your German profile using the search phrase "Highlander Kurzbeschreibung", the service will not
            be found. If you use "Highlander" or "Kurzbeschreibung" as the search phrase, it will be found.
          </p>
          <p>  
            The reason may also be the organizational unit to which you belong. It may have limited access to services. 
            Contact your administrator if you can't find the service you are looking for.

          </p>

          <p>You have to specify a billing address and the payment type:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The billing address defines which organization name and address will be printed on your invoices
              and to which email address your invoices will be sent. If billing addresses have already been defined, you
              can select one of them. As an organization administrator, you can define a new billing address, if required.
              <li>The payment type determines how you want to pay for the subscription. If payment types have
                already been defined, you can select one of them. As an organization administrator, you can define a 
                new payment type, if required.
          </ul>
          <p>You can change the billing addresses and payment types at any time.</p>
          <p>Here is how:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Log in as an organization administrator.
              <li>Click <b>Account</b> in the top bar.
                <li>Click <b>Payment</b> on the left side.
                  <li>To edit an existing billing address or payment type, click <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/edit.png"
                      width="20" height="20" alt="" /> for it.
                    <li>To add a new billing address or payment type, click <b>Add Billing Address</b> or <b>Add

				<li>Identify the users you want to import.<br><br> You can apply filter criteria to select specific users only. To list all users matching the filter criteria, click <b>Search</b>.
				<br><br>You can use the following filter criteria:<br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Wildcard (*): All users existing in the LDAP system are listed. Be aware that a maximum of 100 users can be listed. Use more specific filter criteria, if necessary, for example, the starting character of user IDs together with a wildcard. 
					<li>Characters and wildcards (*): All users are listed whose ID matches the specified characters. For example, if you enter *o*, all users whose ID contains the character o are listed. 
					<li>User ID: To import one specific user, enter his ID directly. 
				</ul>
				<li>Select the check boxes for the users you want to import. If the email address of a user cannot be read from the LDAP system, you have to enter the email address manually.
				<li>Assign the desired user roles. Users to whom you do not assign any role are registered as standard users without any specific privileges.
				<li>To start the import, click <b>Import</b>.
          </ol>
			<p>The selected users are imported and registered. After a successful import, the users are sent an email with the URL for accessing the provided services. They are automatically added to your organization's default organizational unit. The default organizational unit contains all users currently registered for your organization. Click <a href="#ugone" onclick="javascript:anzeigen('infoug1')">here</a> for details.</p> 
		<p>If the user ID of a user to be imported already exists in the platform, the email address of this user 
		(e.g. <code>userSmith@organization.com</code>) is used as user ID for logging in to the system. 
		If yet another user with the same ID is imported, the new user ID is constructed using the existing 
		ID followed by the "at" sign (@) and the ID of the organization the user belongs to (e.g. <code>userSmith@abcdefg</code>). 
		The user is sent an email with the respective user ID.
		</p>
			<p>User data maintained in the LDAP system, such as the password, first name, or last name, can only be changed in the LDAP system. If the data is changed, the marketplace automatically synchronizes it. Be aware that an automatic synchronization is not possible in case a user ID is changed in the LDAP system. The user has to be imported again.</p>

          </h3>
		  <div style="display: none;" id="infoug1">
          <p>
            <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/icon-a.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" />
            An organizational unit is a set of users within an organization. It can, for example, represent a department in a company, an individual project, or a single person. 
          <p>An organizational unit provides a means to restrict the visibility of services to the unit members. When a user logs in on a marketplace, he has access only to the services that are visible to the organizational units to which he belongs. An organizational unit can also be assigned one or more subscriptions, for example, for cost controlling purposes. Note, however, that users can be assigned to and work with a subscription independently of the organizational units they belong to.  
          </p>
          <p>
            As an organization administrator, you are responsible for creating organizational units. A user can be a member of multiple units. 
            Each organization can have any number of units.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an organization administrator, you can change the properties and members of any unit in your organization. One or more users in a 
            unit can be appointed as OU administrators. For their units, OU administrators can change the description and members, define the visible services, 
            and create, modify, and terminate subscriptions. 
          </p>
          <p>
          	Assign users to organizational units carefully. Take into account that, for example, a service manager who publishes a service to a marketplace will not be able to see the service on the marketplace if you do not assign him to the appropriate organizational unit.
          </p>

            <img class="vmiddle" style="margin-right: 5px;" src="../img/icon-a.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="" />
            Each organization has a default organizational unit to which all users of the organization belong.
          <p>
            Any service that is published to a marketplace is automatically visible to the members of the default unit. 
            As an organization administrator, you have to explicitly mark a service as not visible for the unit, if required.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As an organization administrator, you are also responsible for creating additional organizational units. As soon as you assign a user to one or more additional units, the services marked as visible to the members of the default unit are no longer relevant for this user. 
          </p>
          <p>It is not possible to add or remove users from the default organizational unit. However, the name of the default organizational unit can be changed, and services can be assigned and deassigned.</p>
          <p>Be aware of the following:</p>
			<p>As an organization administrator, OU administrator, or subscription manager, you can upgrade or downgrade subscriptions. If you do so, make sure that 
			all services that are involved in an up/downgrade path need to be made accessible in the same organizational unit. The available services are defined by the supplier. </p>

            As an organization administrator you can create, edit and delete organizational units. OU administrators can change
            the descriptions and members of the organizational units they are responsible for.
          <p>
            Here is how to create an organizational unit:
          </p>

            <li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li> 
          </ol> 
          
          <p>Here is how to edit organizational units:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Log in as an organization administrator or as an OU administrator.</li>  
            <li>Click <b>Account</b> in the top bar.</li>

                      width="20" height="20" alt="" /> next to the name of the organizational unit you want to edit.</li>
            <li>Make the desired changes in the <b>Edit organizational unit</b> dialog:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>To change the unit name, enter the new name in the <b>Name</b> field. This action is only available to organization administrators.</li> 
                <li>To change the Reference ID, remove the old ID and enter a new one. This action is only available to organization administrators.</li>
                <li>To make services visible to the unit, check them under <b>Accessible services</b>.</li>
                <li>To make a service invisible, deselect it under <b>Accessible services</b>.</li>
                <li>To add new members to the unit, check them in the table <b>Organizational unit members</b>.
                    As an organization administrator, you can set or remove the role of an OU administrator for each user in the <b>Role in unit</b> column.</li>
                <li>To remove members from the unit, deselect them in the table <b>Organizational unit members</b>.</li></ul>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b></li></ol>

            Certain actions on the marketplace can be carried out under the control of an external process control system. You can configure so-called triggers which are invoked when the actions are carried out. The triggers start the corresponding process in the process control system. If approval for an action is required, the action is suspended until it is approved or rejected in the process control system. If no approval is required, the action is instantly executed.</p>
            <p>As a prerequisite for controlling actions by processes, a notification service must exist and be deployed. This service forms the interface between the marketplace and the process control system. For details on implementing such a service, contact the marketplace owner.</p>
            <p>Then you can define the process triggers.</p>
          <p>Here is how:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Log in as an organization administrator.
              <li>Click <b>Account</b> in the top bar.
                <li>Click <b>Processes</b> on the left side.
               <li>Click <b>Add Process Trigger</b>, and proceed with the
                      definition of the trigger details.
                 <li>From the <b>Type</b> list, select the action which is to be subject to process control. The
                    list contains all actions for which triggers can be configured:<br><br>
			<ul>
			<li>A subscription is to be added (<code>Subscribe to service</code>). </li>	    
			<li>A subscription is to be terminated (<code>Terminate subscription</code>). </li>	    
			<li>A subscription is to be changed, for example, renamed (<code>Modify subscription</code>). </li>	    
			<li>A subscription is to be upgraded or downgraded (<code>Up/Downgrade subscription</code>). </li>	    
            <li>A user is to be assigned to or removed from a subscription (<code>Assign users to subscription</code>). <br>
                For the case that a user is automatically assigned to a new subscription when subscribing to a service, 
                no trigger can be configured. The <code>Assign users to subscription</code> trigger only applies to users that 
                are manually assigned to a subscription. 
            </li>          
            <li>A billing run is completed, and the billing data for a billing period is calculated (<code>Billing run finished</code>). </li>
            <li>A user is to be registered (<code>Register user</code>). <br>
                Triggers can only be configured for registering single users. The import of multiple users in one operation from an LDAP system or a user data file cannot be executed under process control.</li>
            </ul>
		<p>As a supplier, you can configure the following additional triggers: 
          <ul>
            <li>A customer is to be registered (<code>Register customer</code>). </li>
            <li>The payment types for a customer are to be changed (<code>Manage payment types for customer</code>). </li>
            <li>A marketable service is to be activated (<code>Activate service</code>). </li>
            <li>A marketable service is to be deactivated (<code>Deactivate service</code>). </li>

          <p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Started</b>: The action was initialized on the platform.
            <li><b>Waiting for reply</b>: The action has to be approved in the process control system before it is executed. 
            <li><b>Approved</b>: The action has been approved in the process control system, and it has been executed. For example, if you requested to subscribe to a service, the subscription has been created.
            <li><b>Rejected</b>: The action has not been approved in the process control system; it will not be executed. 
            <li><b>Notified</b>: The action has been executed successfully, and the process control system has been informed about its execution. 
            <li><b>The external system did not accept the action</b>: The communication with the process control system failed; the action is not executed.
            <li><b>The platform could not execute the action</b>: An error occurred in the execution of the action after the action had been approved in the process control system. The action is not executed.

             If you are logged in as an administrator, you can choose whether all actions of your organization's users which have triggered a process are to be listed, or only your own actions.</p> 
          <p>To abort the execution of an action, select the check box next to it and click <b>Abort</b>. Only actions in the <b>Waiting for reply</b> status can be aborted.<br>
             The status is changed to <b>Aborted</b>. The action no longer waits for approval in the process control system. It is not executed and can be deleted from the list. The process control system is informed about the abortion of the action and can stop processing the request for approval.</p>
          <p>To delete an action from the list, select the check box next to it and click <b>Delete</b>. Only actions that are not in the <b>Waiting for reply</b> status can be deleted.</p>
