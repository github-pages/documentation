            <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Update marketplace</span> page, the following tasks can be performed: </p>

            <div class="p">
                <ul>
                    <li class="liexpand">Assign another owner to the marketplace. This can be done by the platform operator.</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Define revenue shares for the marketplace and the default revenue shares for broker and reseller organizations. Revenue shares can be defined by the platform operator. </li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Associate another tenant, for example, to reset the system to use the default Identity Provider (IdP). This can be done by the platform operator and is possible only if the system is installed in SAML_SP mode. Be aware that any existing subscriptions to services published on the marketplace can no longer be accessed if you change the tenant association.</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Provide a different name for the marketplace. This can be done by a marketplace manager of the organization owning the marketplace. </li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Change the marketplace features and settings. This can be done by a marketplace manager of the organization owning the marketplace. </li>

                </ul>

            </div>

        <ol><li class="stepexpand">
                <span>From the <span class="uicontrol">Marketplace</span> list, select the marketplace whose owner you want to change. </span>
                 
                    <p>The list contains all marketplaces that exist on your platform.</p>

<li class="stepexpand">

                    <p><strong>Caution</strong>: Assigning a new owner to a marketplace may remove the marketplace owner role from the previous owner organization and the marketplace manager role from its users. This is the case if the marketplace for which you change the owner is the last one owned by the organization.</p>

                    <p>The administrators of the new owner organization are assigned the marketplace manager role. They are notified by email. The email contains two URLs. One can be used by the marketplace managers for administrating and customizing the marketplace. The other can be used for public access to the marketplace.</p>

                                <li><span class="uicontrol">Marketplace owner revenue share (%)</span>: Revenue share the marketplace owner is to receive from organizations who offer and sell services on the selected marketplace.

                                <li><span class="uicontrol">Broker revenue share (%)</span>: Default revenue share all broker organizations will receive for selling services of suppliers who have authorized the brokers to do so. The default revenue share applies if no service-specific or organization-specific revenue share is defined using the <span class="uicontrol">Manage broker revenue share</span> menu option. </li>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Enter the following values: </p>
<div class="p">
                            <ul>

                            </ul>

                        </div>
<p><strong>Situation 1</strong>: Only supplier organizations publish services to the marketplace. The operator revenue share is defined to be 10%. The marketplace owner receives 10% of the revenues resulting from selling the suppliers' services; the supplier organization receives the rest minus the operator revenue share (90% - 10% = 80%). </p>
<p><strong>Situation 2</strong>: A supplier has authorized a reseller to sell his services on the marketplace. The operator revenue share is defined to be 10%. The marketplace owner receives 10% of the revenues, the reseller receives 30%, the supplier receives the rest minus the operator revenue share (60% - 10% = 50%). </p>
<p><strong>Situation 3</strong>: A supplier has authorized a broker to offer his services on the marketplace. The operator revenue share is defined to be 10%. The marketplace owner receives 10% of the revenues, the broker receives 20%, the supplier receives the rest minus the operator revenue share (70% - 10% = 60%).</p>
<p id="task634__revenueshare">The values you enter for revenue share percentages are based on agreed conditions between the operator, marketplace owners, suppliers, resellers, and brokers. You as the operator are responsible for setting correct values. It is possible to set the percentages to a total of over 100%. This might be intentional. For example, a supplier who wants to strongly promote a service for a limited period of time may grant a broker or reseller a revenue share of 80%. In addition, the supplier may need to pay 30% of the revenue to the marketplace owner and 10% to the operator. This results in a total revenue share percentage of 120 and thus in a negative revenue for the supplier. </p>

                    <li class="liexpand">To save the revenue shares, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.<p>The shares are applied when the next billing run is started. The individual shares are calculated and output in the billing data.</p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Revenue shares are calculated only for services applying the platform's native billing system. Services using an external billing system are not included in the calculation. </div>

</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Change the <span class="uicontrol">Tagging</span> feature for the marketplace, if required. <span>When enabled, the tag cloud is available on the marketplace. It contains search terms that characterize the services offered on the marketplace. Visitors to the marketplace can filter the displayed services by these tags. The tags are specified by the technology providers who technically prepare the applications underlying the offered services.</span>
                        <p><span>When you disable this feature, the tag cloud and the tags for the individual services are not displayed on the marketplace. The tags defined for the services are not affected.</span></p>
</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Change the <span class="uicontrol">Reviews</span> feature for the marketplace, if required. <span><span>When enabled, customers who subscribed to services on the marketplace can rate these services and write comments on them. Other visitors can see the ratings and comments.</span></span><p><span>When you disable this feature, ratings and comments are not available on the marketplace.</span> Existing ratings and comments are retained, but they are not visible.

</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Change the <span class="uicontrol">Social bookmarks</span> feature for the marketplace, if required. <span><span>When enabled, bookmarks for direct access to social networks and communication services are provided with the services on the marketplace.

When enabled, only authorized supplier, broker, and reseller organizations are allowed to publish services to the marketplace. As a marketplace manager of the marketplace owner organization, you are responsible for defining these sellers. <p><span>When you disable this feature, the marketplace is open to any supplier, broker, and reseller organization. Any seller is allowed to publish services to the marketplace without the explicit authorization of the marketplace owner.</span></p>
<p><span id="task634__When_you_switch_from_an_open_task_taskbody_result_p_5_ol">When you switch from an open marketplace to a marketplace for authorized sellers only, the sellers of all the services published so far are automatically admitted to it. Furthermore, the blacklist of the open marketplace is retained. This means that sellers you excluded from the marketplace will still be excluded, if you later decide to change the marketplace back to an open one.</span></p>
<p><span id="task634__The_same_applies_in_the_oppos_task_taskbody_result_p_5_ol">The same applies in the opposite direction: The list of authorized sellers is retained when you turn a marketplace into an open one.

</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Change the <span class="uicontrol">Categories</span> feature for the marketplace, if required. When enabled, categories are shown on the marketplace. As a marketplace manager of the marketplace owner organization, you can define categories which suppliers, brokers, and resellers can assign to the services they publish to the marketplace. The categories can be used by visitors of the marketplace for filtering and browsing the services. The categories are also taken into consideration by the full-text search feature on the marketplace.<p>When you disable this feature, categories are no longer available to marketplace visitors for searching, filtering and browsing, but can still be defined and assigned to services. Existing category definitions and assignments are not affected.</p>
<div class="p">
                            <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> As a marketplace manager, you can use categories for grouping the services displayed on the marketplace home page.
