            <p>Single sign-on (SSO) is supported when the platform is installed in SAML_SP mode for user authentication. This authentication mode requires the definition of an Identity Provider (IdP) against which all platform users are authenticated when accessing a marketplace or the administration portal. User IDs and passwords of the organization are maintained in the IdP system, such as OpenAM or Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS). </p>

            <p>Any organization still needs to register its users with the platform. The user credentials must match the ones maintained in the IdP system. Connection settings have to be defined in a configuration file so that the platform can connect to the IdP system.</p>

            <p>The initial IdP defined when installing the platform in SAML_SP mode is used platform-wide, i.e. for all users registered on the platform. This initial IdP is called "default IdP". In addition, the operator can define tenants and associate an IdP system with each tenant. Marketplaces and organizations can then be associated with a tenant. In this way, the users of an organization with access to such a marketplace are authenticated against the IdP system associated with this tenant when accessing the marketplace or the administration portal. </p>

            <p>Users are always authenticated against the IdP associated with the respective marketplace or administration portal. Users of different organizations are authenticated against a different IdP if they access a different marketplace have a tenant with a different IdP associated with it.</p>

            <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage tenants</span> page, you can define and manage tenants. For each tenant, you can define the connection settings to the IdP that is to be associated with the tenant. If no tenant is defined, users are authenticated against the default IdP specified when installing the platform in SAML_SP mode.</p>

                 In the file, the following parameters must be defined: <div class="p">

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In the IdP system, a URL must be specified to which the response to the logout request is sent and the user is redirected by the logout.

                            <li><samp class="codeph"><strong>SSO_STS_METADATA_URL</strong></samp><p>The URL of the MEX address (Issuer Metadata Exchange) of the STS. This parameter is required for Security Token Service (STS) communication.</p>

                            <li><samp class="codeph"><strong>SSO_IDP_SAML_ASSERTION_ISSUER_ID</strong></samp><p>The entity ID of the IdP system. This ID is unique for the IdP system and has to be communicated between the platform operator and the IdP administrator. It is required so that the platform can ensure that the authentication information returned from the IdP system actually comes from the IdP system that is configured for authenticating users. </p>
<p>The IdP administrator can find out the ID by retrieving the federation metadata on his IdP system. </p>
<strong>Examples</strong>:<p>On the OpenAM server, the federation metadata can be retrieved in a Web browser as follows: </p>
<p><samp class="codeph">https://&lt;OpenAM_server&gt;/openam/saml2/jsp/exportmetadata.jsp?entityid=</samp></p>
<p>On the ADFS server, look for the following file: </p>
<p><samp class="codeph">http://&lt;ADFShost&gt;/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml</samp></p>
<p>In the XML file, the issuer ID is known as <samp class="codeph">entityID</samp>, for example; </p>
<p><samp class="codeph">entityID="http://example.adfs.com/adfs/services/trust"</samp>
                                </p>
