  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage users</span> page, you can lock the account of a specific user, for example when you assume unauthorized access. You can also unlock an account, for example in case it was locked because the user tried to log in using a wrong password for the configured number of times (default: 3). In addition, you can initiate the generation of a new password for a user. </p>

      <p>In addition, you can register multiple users in one operation by importing a user data file. </p>

      <p>At the top of the page, you can view the number of users registered with the platform as well as the configured maximum number of registered users (default: 10). At regular intervals (default: 12 hours), the system checks the number of registered users. You are informed by email when this check returns that the allowed number of registered users is exceeded. </p>

      <p>All tasks are executed on request of an organization's administrator who will provide you with the relevant user IDs. </p>

      <div class="p" id="task634__LDAPRestrictions">
        <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If an organization uses an external LDAP system for user management and authentication, only those fields that are not mapped to settings in the LDAP system can be edited. For example, passwords can be changed only in the external system. </div>

      <p><strong>To reset a password or lock/unlock a user</strong>:</p>

        <span>Enter the ID of the user or select it from the list. </span>

      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p>In all cases, the selected user is notified by email. </p>

      <p><strong>To register multiple users for an organization</strong>:</p>

      <div class="p">

          <li class="liexpand">Request the organization's administrator to provide a file containing the user data or create the file yourself.<span> Refer to <a href="../../Shared/reference/r_FileFormat_ImportUsers.htm">User data file for multiple user import</a> for details on the format and content.</span> </li>

          <li class="liexpand">Import the user data file: <div class="p">
              <ol type="a">
                <li class="liexpand">Select the organization for which you want to import users. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">Select the marketplace to which the users are to be directed. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">Click the <strong>File name</strong> field or <strong>Browse</strong>, and select the file containing the user data.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Click <strong>Import</strong>. <p>The system validates the user data file before starting the actual import. It checks whether: </p>
<div class="p"><ul>
                      <li class="liexpand">All lines containing user data are complete (all fields are specified).</li>

                      <li class="liexpand">The spelling of the values for title and user roles is correct.</li>

                      <li class="liexpand">Multiple user roles are enclosed in double quotes.</li>

                    </ul>
If an error is found during the validation of the user data file, a corresponding message is displayed and the import does not start. </div>
<p>You must correct the information in the file before you can start the import again. </p>
<p>You cannot start multiple imports at a time. You need to wait until the current import is finished. For long lists of users, this may take some time.</p>

              </ol>

</li>

        </ol>

      </div>

      <p>As soon as the import is finished, all users who have been imported and registered successfully are sent an email with the login data and an initial password to be used for the first login. The newly registered users are automatically added to the organization's default organizational unit. The default unit contains all users currently registered for the organization.</p>

      <p>You are sent an email with the following information: </p>

      <div class="p">
        <ul>
          <li class="liexpand">Number of users who were imported and registered successfully. </li>

          <li class="liexpand">For every user that was not imported: user ID and reason.<p>Possible reasons are: </p>
<ul>
              <li class="liexpand">A user with the specified ID already exists.</li>

              <li class="liexpand">The specified user ID is invalid. </li>

              <li class="liexpand">The specified user role is not available for the organization. For example, if the organization is a supplier, the <samp class="codeph">BROKER_MANAGER</samp> user role cannot be specified.</li>
