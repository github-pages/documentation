  <h1 class="topictitle1">Registering customers</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Register customer</span> page, you can register customers so that they do not need to do this themselves.</p>

      <p>Registering a customer creates a new organization as well as an initial administrator account. All login information is automatically sent to this administrator by email. The default organizational unit is also created. The administrator is the first member of this default unit. Any user who will be registered for the organization is automatically added to the default unit. Additional units can be created by the administrators of the organization.</p>

      <p>As a prerequisite for registering a customer, the marketplace to which the new customer is to be directed must already exist.</p>

      <p><strong>To register new customers</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Enter the following user data for the first administrator of the new customer organization.</span>

            <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Email</span>: Email address of the organization's administrator. Notifications about the creation of the account and access information will be sent to this address. <p>The system checks whether the syntax of the given email address is valid, and whether the domain name corresponds to the standards as defined and maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). </p>
<p>Examples: <samp class="codeph">user.name@domain.arpa</samp>, <samp class="codeph">user.name@domain.org</samp>, <samp class="codeph">user@mycompany.lan.uk</samp></p>

            <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Desired user ID</span>: User ID of the organization's administrator. User IDs are restricted to 100 characters and must not contain any of the following characters:<p><samp class="codeph">! " # $ % &amp; ' * + , / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? \ ^ `</samp></p>
<div class="p">
                <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the customer's organization uses an external system for user authentication, the ID of the user to be registered must match an existing ID in the external system. </div>

              </div>
</li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Language</span>: Language in which the administrator will work by default. The user interface, available documentation, and emails will be presented to the administrator in the language specified here. The administrator can change the language later. The list of available languages depends on the platform operator's definition of supported languages. </li>

<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Specify the following data for the new customer organization. Once you have registered the customer, the organization data can be edited only by administrators of the new organization.

              <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Email</span>: Email address for general communication with the organization. The organization can later specify a separate email address to which invoices can be sent.<p>The system checks whether the syntax of the given email address is valid, and whether the domain name corresponds to the standards as defined and maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). </p>
<p>Examples: <samp class="codeph">user.name@domain.arpa</samp>, <samp class="codeph">user.name@domain.org</samp>, <samp class="codeph">user@mycompany.lan.uk</samp></p>
</li>

              <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Phone</span>: Phone number of the organization.</li>

It may, for example, provide information from the company's profile.<p>The text you enter is stored in the language defined by your user profile.

      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>From the <span class="uicontrol">Marketplace</span> list, select the marketplace to which the new customer is to be directed. </span>
         The list contains all marketplaces to which you have been granted access by the marketplace owner.

<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>If the customer is to use a remote LDAP system for user authentication, select the <span class="uicontrol">Use LDAP-based authentication</span> check box. </span>
         
          <div class="p">
            <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> This option is not available if users are authenticated against a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider.</div>

          </div>

          <p>Create an LDAP configuration file on your file system, and define the LDAP connection settings in the file. To load the configuration file, click the <span class="uicontrol">LDAP settings</span> entry field or <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span>, and select the file containing the settings. If you do not specify an organization-specific configuration file, the platform default settings for LDAP connections will be used. </p>

          <p>When using an external LDAP system, your customer does not need to register his users manually. The administrator of the customer organization can import the users from the LDAP system, thus automatically registering basic information for them.</p>

          <p>Here is a sample configuration file: </p>

          <div class="p">
            <pre class="codeblock">LDAP_BASE_DN=ou\=people,dc\=est,dc\=mycompany,dc\=de
LDAP_CONTEXT_FACTORY=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
LDAP_URL=ldap://myldapserver.lan.est.company.de:389
LDAP_ATTR_UID=uid
LDAP_ATTR_LAST_NAME=sn
LDAP_ATTR_FIRST_NAME=givenName
LDAP_ATTR_EMAIL=scalixEmailAddress
LDAP_ATTR_REFERRAL=ignore</pre>

          </div>

          <p>The defaults shown in the sample are defined for <samp class="codeph">LDAP_CONTEXT_FACTORY</samp> and <samp class="codeph">LDAP_ATTR_UID</samp>, i.e. if you do not specify a value, these defaults apply when creating the organization unless the platform operator has defined different ones in the default LDAP settings for the platform.</p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To save your entries, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p>After registering the customer, the administrator of the new customer organization is sent an email with the URL for accessing the selected marketplace and with the login data and an initial password to be used for the first login. </p>

      <p>If the organization uses an external authentication system:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <ul>
          <li>Passwords are managed in this system. Therefore, the administrator is sent an email without a password. The password stored in the external authentication system must be used for logging in.</li>

          <li>If the user ID of the administrator already exists in the platform, his email address (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@organization.com</samp>) is used as user ID for logging in to the system. If yet another customer organization is registered and the user ID of the administrator is again identical, the new user ID is constructed using the existing ID followed by the "at" sign (@) and the ID of the customer organization (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@abcdefg</samp>). The administrator is sent an email with the respective user ID.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>As a supplier or reseller, your next step is typically to specify the payment types available for the customer so that he can choose his preferred way of paying for his subscriptions. Payment types as well as billing addresses are relevant for services that use the platform's native billing system and are not free of charge. Even for these services, however, your operator may deactivate any possibilities for customers to enter such payment information. If this is the case, the definition of payment types is not possible.</p>
