  <h1 class="topictitle1">Defining a service price model</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Define for service</span> page, you can define or update a price model for the selected service. </p>

      <p>You have selected a service that is charged for using an <strong>external billing system</strong>. The price models for calculating the charges are also defined and managed in this billing system. You need to import the appropriate price model for the service in the platform. You can view the price model but not modify it on the platform. To change the price model, you need to import it again after the relevant information has been updated in the external billing system. </p>

      <p><strong>To define or update a service price model</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Define the price model</span> section, click <span class="uicontrol">Import</span> to import the price model from the external system.</span>
         The billing adapter, that connects the platform with the external billing system, is responsible for providing the correct price model. You can view the price model by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Display</span>. 
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Edit the <strong>license agreement</strong> as desired. The license agreement must be read and accepted by customers when they subscribe to the service.</span>
         
          <p>By default, the license agreement of the technology provider is used. It is up to you whether you use this license agreement or specify a different one. </p>

          <p>You can specify the license agreement in additional languages later by localizing the price model.</p>

          <p>Resellers who sell the service can provide their own license agreement. It is up to them whether they use the license agreement as you enter it or specify a different one. If you change the license agreement, the reseller's license agreement is not updated.</p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To save the price model, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>. </span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To provide the license agreement in another language, click <span class="uicontrol">Localize</span>.</span>
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p>After activating the service, the price model is available to customers. It takes effect for all new subscriptions.</p>

      <p>Brokers and resellers as well as their customers can instantly view any changes you have made.</p>
