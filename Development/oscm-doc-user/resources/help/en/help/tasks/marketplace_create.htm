  <h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a marketplace</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Create marketplace</span> page, you can create a marketplace to be operated on your platform.</p>

      <p>Creating a marketplace includes defining the marketplace features and settings and assigning an organization as the owner. The organization you assign as the owner is automatically assigned the marketplace owner role. All administrators automatically receive the marketplace manager role. The marketplace manager role enables them to administrate and customize the marketplace.</p>

      <p>As a prerequisite for creating a marketplace, the organization to be assigned as the marketplace owner must already exist.</p>

      <p>If the platform is installed in SAML_SP mode, you can associate a tenant with the marketplace. The tenant defines the Identity Provider (IdP) against which users accessing the marketplace are to be authenticated. </p>

      <p><strong>To create a marketplace</strong>:</p>

It contains search terms that characterize the services offered on the marketplace. Visitors to the marketplace can filter the displayed services by these tags. The tags are specified by the technology providers who technically prepare the applications underlying the offered services.</span></p>

              <p><span id="task634__With_task_taskbody_steps_step_2">When you disable this feature, the tag cloud and the tags for the individual services are not displayed on the marketplace. The tags defined for the services are not affected.</span></p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>The administrators of the owner organization are assigned the marketplace manager role. They are notified by email about the creation of the marketplace. The email contains two URLs. One can be used by the marketplace managers for administrating and customizing the marketplace. The other can be used for public access to the marketplace. </p>

      <p>Once you have created a marketplace, your role as a platform operator allows you to change the marketplace owner, to delete the marketplace, if required, and to change the association with a tenant.</p>
