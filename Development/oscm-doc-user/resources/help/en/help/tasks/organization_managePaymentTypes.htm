  <h1 class="topictitle1">Adding payment types</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">New payment type</span> page, you can add the payment types to be available for a supplier or reseller organization. The payment types defined here can later be made available for selection by customers. </p>

      <p><strong>To add a payment type</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>From the <span class="uicontrol">Payment service provider</span> list, select the PSP that offers the payment type that you want to assign to the selected supplier or reseller organization. </span>
         
          <p>The list contains all PSPs registered and configured on your platform.</p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <strong>PSP identifier</strong> field, enter the identifier or account number for the supplier or reseller as provided by the PSP. </span>
         Suppliers and resellers need to have a contractual relationship with the PSP. The PSP configures the channel for a supplier or reseller and issues an identifier, usually an account number, so that payments can be immediately linked to the supplier's or reseller's account.
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Select the types of payment that the selected supplier or reseller may offer to his customers.</span>
         Next to <strong>Payment</strong>, you see the payment types offered by the selected PSP. The available payment types depend on the configuration of the PSP.
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To save your entries, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
         
          <div class="p">
            <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> You can no longer remove a payment type which has been assigned to a supplier or reseller organization.</div>

          </div>
