        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Charging conditions</h4>
            
            <p>The charging conditions include the following information:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="liexpand">
                    <div class="p" id="reference832__For_each_subscription_a_char_reference_refbody_section_1"><strong>Calculation option</strong>: The cost calculation option for the price model:<ul>
                            <li><span class="uicontrol">Free of charge</span>: The service is free of charge. </li>

                            <li><span class="uicontrol">Pro rata calculation</span>: The costs are calculated based on the exact usage of the service in milliseconds.</li>

                            <li><span class="uicontrol">Per time unit calculation</span>: The costs are calculated for complete time units, for example, whole days or weeks. The time unit is defined under <span class="uicontrol">Charges based on</span>.</li>

                        </ul>
</div>

                </li>

                <li class="liexpand"><strong>Free trial period (in days)</strong>: The number of days during which the service can be used for free. <span>After this period, the service automatically turns into a chargeable service.</span></li>

                <li class="liexpand"><strong>Currency</strong> in which a customer is charged for using the service. The supported currencies are defined by the operator. The currency cannot be changed when defining a subscription price model.</li>

                <li class="liexpand"><strong>Charges based on</strong>: The time unit for recurring charges. The charges can be on a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis. The option selected here also defines the time unit for per time unit calculation. The time unit cannot be changed when defining a subscription price model.</li>

                <li class="liexpand"><strong>One-time fee</strong> to be paid when subscribing to the service. This fee is added to the usage charges for the first billing period. </li>

                <li class="liexpand"><strong>Recurring charge per subscription</strong>: The charge to be paid for a subscription on a recurring basis as specified in the <span class="uicontrol">Charges based on</span> field. </li>

                <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Recurring charge for users</strong>: The charge to be paid per time unit users are assigned to a subscription. The time unit is defined in the <span class="uicontrol">Charges based on</span> field. For this type of charge, you can specify stepped prices, for example, to grant discounts depending on the amount of time users work with a subscription</span></li>

            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Event prices</h4>
            
            <p>Event prices refer to individual, billable events. <span>These include, for example, login and logout by users to the underlying application, the completion of specific transactions, or the creation or deletion of specific data. It depends on the implementation and integration of the underlying application which events are available.</span>
            </p>

            <p>For this type of charge, stepped prices can be defined granting the customer, for example, discounts depending on the number of events that occurred while using the service.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Parameter prices</h4>
            
            <p>A price model can define prices for service parameters and options. <span>It depends on the implementation and integration of the underlying application whether and which parameters and options are available.</span> The supplier can define a price for every parameter and option, and specify whether this price is to be charged per subscription or per user assigned to the subscription. Numeric parameters are a multiplier for the price. For boolean parameters, the multiplier is <samp class="codeph">1</samp> if the value is <samp class="codeph">true</samp>. In all other cases, the multiplier is <samp class="codeph">0</samp>.</p>

            <p>For numeric parameters (parameters with values of type Integer or Long), stepped prices can be defined granting the customer, for example, volume discounts.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Role-specific prices</h4>
            
            <p>A price model can define a price for each service role that is defined. This price is added to the base price per user in the cost calculation for a billing period.</p>

            <p>The service roles must have been specified in the technical service definition. Service roles can be mapped to corresponding permissions in the underlying application. </p>
