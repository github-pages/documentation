      <p>
        <span>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage sellers</span> page, you can decide who is allowed to publish services to a marketplace.</span>
      </p>

      <p>You have selected a marketplace for authorized sellers only. In this case, you have to admit one or more supplier, broker, or reseller organizations that are to be allowed to publish services to it. When the marketplace is created, the organization specified as the marketplace owner is automatically admitted, provided that it is assigned the supplier, broker, or reseller role. The page lists all sellers that are currently admitted.</p>

      <p>
        <span>As the marketplace owner, you can revoke the publishing approval for a seller at any time, for example if he is in arrears with his payments. If the seller already published services to the marketplace, these services are automatically deactivated. Customers can no longer subscribe to them. Existing subscriptions are not affected.</span>
      </p>

      <p>When you allow a seller to publish services or remove the authority for publishing, the administrators of the seller organization are automatically notified by email.</p>

      <p><strong>To allow a seller to publish services to the selected marketplace</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Type the organization ID of the seller in the <span class="uicontrol">Organization ID</span> field. </span>
         Contact the seller to get his organization ID.
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Authorize</span>. </span>
         The authorization takes effect immediately. The seller can publish his services to the marketplace.
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>To remove the authority for publishing services for a seller</strong>:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <ol>
          <li class="liexpand">Select the check box next to the seller whose authority you want to remove.<p>You can select one or several check boxes.</p>
</li>

          <li class="liexpand">Click <span class="uicontrol">Exclude</span> and confirm the exclusion.<p>The exclusion takes effect immediately. The seller can no longer publish his services to the marketplace.</p>
</li>
