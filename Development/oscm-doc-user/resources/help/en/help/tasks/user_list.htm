  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage users</span> page, you can manage the users registered for your organization. You can change user data and user roles, reset a user's password, and delete users.</p>

      <div class="p">
        <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In case your organization uses an external system for user management and authentication, passwords can only be changed in the external system. Therefore, the option for resetting the password is not visible.</div>

      </div>

      <p><strong>To change user data and user roles</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the list in the upper page area, select the user whose data and user roles you want to change.</span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the fields in the lower page area, change the user data by editing the corresponding fields. </span>

<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To change the roles of a selected user, select or clear the corresponding <span class="uicontrol">User role</span> check boxes. The user roles you can select depend on the role of your organization:</span>
         
          <ul>
            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Administrator</strong>: Each organization must have at least one user with this role. <span id="task634__d1890e90">An administrator can manage the organization's account and subscriptions as well as its users and their roles. The first administrator of an organization is defined when the organization is created.</span></span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>OU administrator</strong>: The users of an organization can be grouped in organizational units (OUs). The OU administrator role allows a user to manage the organizational units for which he has been appointed as an administrator, and to create, modify, and terminate subscriptions for these units.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Subscription manager</strong>: This role allows a user to subscribe to services and manage his own subscriptions. Unlike administrators, subscription managers are not permitted to work on subscriptions belonging to others or on subscription data related to billing and payment.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Technology manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define technical services. It can be assigned to users of technology provider organizations.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Service manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define marketable services and price models as well as publish marketable services. It can be assigned to users of supplier organizations.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Reseller</strong>: This role allows a user to publish a supplier's marketable services applying different terms and conditions. It can be assigned to users of reseller organizations.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Broker</strong>: This role allows a user to publish a supplier's marketable services without changing the terms and conditions defined by the supplier. It can be assigned to users of broker organizations.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Marketplace manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define the organizations who are allowed to publish services to a marketplace as well as update and customize a marketplace. This role can be assigned to users of marketplace owner organizations. It is automatically assigned to all administrators of the marketplace owner organization when a marketplace is created.</span></li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Operator</strong>: This role allows a user to carry out configuration and maintenance tasks, manage organizations, and create marketplaces.</span> The first operator is created together with its operator organization when the platform is installed.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>If you do not select a check box, the user is automatically assigned the role of a standard user. Users with this non-privileged role can work with services their organization has subscribed to.</p>

          <p>If you change the role assignments of a user, the new assignments take effect with the user's next login.</p>
