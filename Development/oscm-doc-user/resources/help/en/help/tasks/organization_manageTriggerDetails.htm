  <h1 class="topictitle1">Managing a trigger</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage trigger</span> page, you can define a new process trigger for your organization or change or delete an existing one.</p>

      <p>As a prerequisite for controlling actions by processes, a notification service must exist and be deployed. This service forms the interface between the platform and the process control system. For details on implementing such a service, contact the platform operator.</p>

      <p><strong>To add a new trigger</strong>: </p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Display as</span> field, enter a name for the trigger as it is to be shown to users on the <span class="uicontrol">Manage processes</span> page. </span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>From the <span class="uicontrol">Type</span> list, select the action which is to be subject to process control. </span>
         
          <p>The list contains all actions for which triggers can be configured. </p>

          <p>For any type of organization, the following triggers can be configured: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>A subscription is to be changed, for example, renamed (<samp class="codeph">Modify subscription</samp>). </li>

            <li>A billing run is completed, and the billing data for a billing period is calculated (<samp class="codeph">Billing run finished</samp>). </li>

            <li>A subscription is to be added (<samp class="codeph">Subscribe to service</samp>). </li>

            <li>A user is to be assigned to or removed from a subscription (<samp class="codeph">Assign users to subscription</samp>). <p>For the case that a user is automatically assigned to a new subscription when subscribing to a service, no trigger can be configured. The <samp class="codeph">Assign users to subscription</samp> trigger only applies to users that are manually assigned to a subscription.</p>
</li>

            <li>A subscription is to be upgraded or downgraded (<samp class="codeph">Up/Downgrade subscription</samp>). </li>

            <li>A subscription is to be terminated (<samp class="codeph">Terminate subscription</samp>). </li>

            <li>A user is to be registered (<samp class="codeph">Register user</samp>).<p>Triggers can only be configured for registering single users. The import of multiple users in one operation from an LDAP system or a user data file cannot be executed under process control.</p>
</li>

          </ul>

          <p>For <strong>suppliers</strong>, the following additional triggers can be configured: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>A customer is to be registered (<samp class="codeph">Register customer</samp>). </li>

            <li>The payment types for a customer are to be changed (<samp class="codeph">Manage payment types for customer</samp>). </li>

            <li>A marketable service is to be activated (<samp class="codeph">Activate service</samp>). </li>

            <li>A marketable service is to be deactivated (<samp class="codeph">Deactivate service</samp>). </li>

            <li>A user subscribes to a service of the supplier organization (<samp class="codeph">Subscription created (any user)</samp>)</li>

            <li>A user modifies a subscription to a service of the supplier (<samp class="codeph">Subscription modified (any user)</samp>)</li>

            <li>A user terminates a subscription to a service of the supplier (<samp class="codeph">Subscription terminated (any user)</samp>)</li>

          </ul>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Target type</span> field, stay with the entry <span class="uicontrol">Web Service</span>. </span>
         
          <p>Currently, this is the only supported type of target. </p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Target URL</span> field, enter the URL of the WSDL file of the notification service implemented for your organization.</span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Specify whether the execution of the action is to be suspended until it is approved or rejected in the external process control system. </span>
         
          <p>If not, the action is instantly executed. The process control system is informed if the action for the non-suspending trigger is executed successfully.</p>

          <p>Note that for the following triggers for suppliers the execution of the action cannot be suspended: <samp class="codeph">Subscription created (any user)</samp>, <samp class="codeph">Subscription modified (any user)</samp>, and <samp class="codeph">Subscription terminated (any user)</samp>.</p>
