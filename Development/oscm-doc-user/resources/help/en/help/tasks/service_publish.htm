          <li class="liexpand">Define or change the marketplace to which a service is to be published. Specifying the marketplace is a prerequisite for activating the service.<p>As a prerequisite for changing the marketplace, the service must be deactivated. Existing subscriptions of customers on the original marketplace are not affected. </p>
</li>

          <li class="liexpand">Grant brokers or resellers the permission to sell a service or revoke such a permission. This can be done by suppliers only.<p>As a prerequisite for granting the permission, the price model and the marketplace must be defined.</p>
<p>If you grant the permission for a service, the broker or reseller can publish the service to a marketplace of his choice. If you revoke the permission for a service, the service is instantly withdrawn from the marketplace to which it was published by the broker or reseller. Customers can no longer subscribe to it, yet existing subscriptions of the broker's or reseller's customers are not affected.</p>
