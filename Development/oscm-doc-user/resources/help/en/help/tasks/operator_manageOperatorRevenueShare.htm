  <h1 class="topictitle1">Managing operator revenue share</h1>

  <div id="On_the_task_taskbody">
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage operator revenue share</span> page, you can define a revenue share for individual services which a supplier offers on the marketplaces operated on your platform. The service-specific revenue share overrules the default operator revenue share defined for a supplier organization when creating or updating the organization. </p>

      <p>The service-specific revenue share applies irrespective of whether the supplier sells his services himself, or uses brokers or resellers for selling them. Discounts granted by a supplier to his customers are deducted from the operator revenue share. </p>

      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage operator revenue share</span> page, you can also update the revenue share for services for which the resale permission has already been revoked and for services which have already been deleted by a supplier. There might still be active subscriptions for these services, therefore it might be necessary for you to update the revenue share.</p>

      <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Revenue shares and discounts are calculated based on the billing data for the customers who use the services. The data is only calculated for services using the platform's native billing system. The costs of services using an external billing system are not included in the calculation. </div>

      <p><strong>To define the service-specific operator revenue share</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Select the service for which the revenue share is to be defined. </span>
         The list contains all services that are available on your platform and all services that have already been deleted. The service name is followed by the organization ID of the supplier who provides the service. 
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>The table shows the default operator revenue share defined for the supplier organization.</span>
         
          <p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Revenue share (%)</span> entry field, you can specify a percent value for the service-specific revenue share: </p>

          <p>This percentage is valid for the selected service and applicable to the supplier publishing this service or authorizing brokers and resellers to do so. The value overrules the default value defined using the <span class="uicontrol">Create organization</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Manage organization</span> menu option, as well as any other previously defined service-specific revenue share. </p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
         
          <p>The value is applied as soon as a customer subscribes to the selected service. The revenue share amounts are calculated when the next billing run is started. </p>

        
      </li>
</ol>
