  <h1 class="topictitle1">Defining a subscription price model</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Define for subscription</span> page, you can define or update a price model for a specific subscription of a selected customer. You can define subscription price models for your direct customers and for your brokers' customers.</p>

      <p>The subscription price model you define or update takes priority over the service price model or a customer price model that is defined. However, you cannot change the cost calculation option. Click <a href="../../Shared/reference/r_PriceModelDetails.htm">here</a> for basic information on price models.</p>

      <p>If you update a subscription price model, <span id="task634__the_modified_settings_are_val_task_taskbody_context_p_2_ph">the modified settings are valid for the current and future billing periods. This means that, for example, all user assignments or billable events that occurred in using the subscription in the current billing period before the change will be charged according to the new price model.</span></p>

      <p><span id="task634__Usually_you_will_change_a_su_task_taskbody_context_p_3_ph">Usually, you will change a subscription price model only in agreement with the relevant customer. For changing a subscription price model, it does not matter whether the relevant service is activated or deactivated.</span></p>

      <p><strong>To define a subscription price model</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the list in the upper page area, select the subscription for which you want to define the price model. </span>
         
          <p>You can select any active subscription to your services. The subscriptions of your direct customers and your brokers' customers are included.</p>

          <p>Below, you can view which cost calculation option is valid for the selected subscription:</p>

          <ul id="task634__Select_task_taskbody_steps_step_2">
            <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Free of charge</span>: The service is free of charge. </li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Pro rata calculation</span>: The costs are calculated based on the exact usage of the service in milliseconds.</li>

            <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Per time unit calculation</span>: The costs are calculated for complete time units, for example, whole days or weeks. The time unit is defined under <span class="uicontrol">Charges based on</span>.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>If the subscription is free of charge, proceed with Step 6, else with Step 2.</p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Description</span> field, enter a detailed description of the price model. It may, for example, provide details of each element the price model consists of.</span>
         
          <p>The description is displayed to the customer on a marketplace when he requests details of the service from the service catalog.</p>

          <p>You can specify the description in additional languages later by localizing the price model.</p>
