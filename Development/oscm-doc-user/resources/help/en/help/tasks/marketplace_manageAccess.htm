  <h1 class="topictitle1">Managing the access to a marketplace</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p><span id="task634__On_the_task_taskbody_context_p_1_ph">On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage access</span> page, you can decide who is allowed to access a marketplace. </span>
      </p>

      <p><span id="task634__When_a_marketplace_is_created_task_taskbody_context_p_2_ph"><span id="task634__When_a_marketplace_small_ph">When a marketplace is created, it is public and accessible by any anonymous or registered users. <span>You</span> can restrict the access to it to the users of specific registered organizations.</span>
        <span id="task634__When_a_marketplace_small2_ph">In this case, the users need to log in to be able to see, subscribe to, and use the services published on the marketplace. New customers cannot register themselves on the marketplace but need to be registered by a supplier, broker, reseller, or the platform operator.</span>
        </span></p>

      <p><span id="task634__If_task_taskbody_context_p_3_ph">If you turn a marketplace from a public into a non-public one, organizations with existing subscriptions are automatically granted access to it. You can at any time revoke the access permission for each of these organizations in the same way as for organizations which were granted access explicitly. As a prerequisite, all subscriptions must have been terminated.</span></p>

      <p><span id="task634__A_marketplace_with_restricted_task_taskbody_context_p_4_ph">A marketplace with restricted access can at any time be made public again and thus accessible by any users and organizations.</span></p>

      <p><strong>To manage the access to a marketplace</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>From the <span class="uicontrol">Marketplace</span> list, select the marketplace for which you want to manage the access permissions. </span>
         
          <p>The list contains all marketplaces to which you have access as a marketplace manager.</p>

          <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Authorized customers only</span> option shows whether the marketplace is public or accessible by users of specific organizations only. In the latter case, the available organizations are listed below with check marks indicating the authorized ones.</p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Change the access policy for the marketplace as required by selecting or deselecting the <span class="uicontrol">Authorized customers only</span> option.</span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>For a marketplace for authorized customers, select the organizations that are to be granted access. </span>
         Remove the check mark to revoke the access permission for an organization. As a prerequisite, the organization must not have any active subscriptions.
