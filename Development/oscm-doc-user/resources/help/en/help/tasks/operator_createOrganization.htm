  <h1 class="topictitle1">Creating an organization</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section"><p id="OrgCreate__On_the_task_taskbody_context_p_1">On the <span class="uicontrol">Create organization</span> page, you can create an organization and specify its role (technology provider, supplier, reseller, broker, or - implicitly - customer only). For every new organization, you must define a user who is to become its first administrator. This user can later register new users and assign roles to them.</p>
<p>Depending on the role of the organization to be created, different fields are mandatory. For example, if you create a customer organization by specifying no role at all, this organization must be assigned a marketplace. The marketplace must already exist. For organizations with other roles, no marketplace assignment is required. </p>
<p><strong>User authentication and management</strong></p>
The platform supports the following authentication modes:<ul>
        <li class="liexpand"><strong>INTERNAL</strong> mode - users are authenticated against the <strong>platform</strong>: User IDs and passwords of an organization are created and maintained in the platform or in an existing LDAP system of the organization. <p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt2">When maintained in the platform, the user data is stored in the platform's database. An organization's administrator can register new users, and, if required, request passwords to be reset by the operator. </p>
<p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt3">When using an LDAP system, an organization does not need to register its users manually with the platform. The organization's administrator can import the users from the LDAP system, thus automatically registering them with the platform. The users are managed in the LDAP system. The platform continuously synchronizes its information on the users. Connection settings have to be defined in a configuration file so that the platform can connect to the LDAP system.</p>
<p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt4">A mixture of maintaining users in the platform and in the LDAP system is not supported. In addition, the type of user management can no longer be changed once an organization has been created.</p>
<p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt5">The operator organization cannot use an external LDAP system. So you can always log in to the platform and change connection settings, for example if the LDAP system of an organization is not available and thus authentication against it is not possible.</p>
<p id="OrgCreate__UserMgmt6">You can define default LDAP configuration settings for the entire platform. The settings in an organization's LDAP configuration file complement or replace the default settings. </p>
</li>

        <li class="liexpand"><strong>SAML_SP</strong> mode - users are authenticated against an <strong>external authentication system</strong> (SAML 2.0 IdP): User IDs and passwords of an organization are created and maintained in the IdP. The platform acts as SAML 2.0 service provider.<p>For enabling users to access the platform, they must exist in the IdP and be registered with the same user ID with the platform.</p>

        </li>

      </ul>
<p><strong>To create a new organization</strong>:</p>
</div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Enter the following user data for the first administrator of the new organization.</span>

              <li class="liexpand">For a supplier organization: <strong>Default operator rev. share (%)</strong>. This is the revenue share agreed between the operator and the supplier, which the operator is to receive from the supplier for selling services on the marketplaces managed on the operator's platform. The default operator revenue share applies to all services offered by the supplier as long as you do not define a service-specific revenue share using the <strong>Manage operator revenue share</strong> menu option in the <strong>Operation</strong> menu. It also applies irrespective of whether the supplier sells his services himself, or uses brokers or resellers for selling them. Discounts granted by a supplier to his customers are deducted from the revenue share. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Revenue shares and discounts are calculated only for services applying the <span>platform's </span>native billing system.

When enabled, a table with the LDAP settings defined for the platform is shown. You must then specify the LDAP configuration file containing the settings required for connecting with the organization's LDAP system:<p>Create an LDAP configuration file on your file system, and define the LDAP connection settings in the file. To load the configuration file, click the <span class="uicontrol">LDAP settings</span> entry field or <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span>, and select the file containing the settings. </p>
<p>Here is a sample configuration file: </p>

          <div class="p" id="OrgCreate__LDAPSample">
            <pre class="codeblock">LDAP_BASE_DN=ou\=people,dc\=est,dc\=mycompany,dc\=de

LDAP_ATTR_LAST_NAME=sn
LDAP_ATTR_FIRST_NAME=givenName
LDAP_ATTR_EMAIL=scalixEmailAddress
LDAP_ATTR_REFERRAL=ignore</pre>

          </div>
<p>The defaults shown in the sample are defined for <samp class="codeph">LDAP_CONTEXT_FACTORY</samp> and <samp class="codeph">LDAP_ATTR_UID</samp>, i.e. if you do not specify a value, this default applies when creating the organization unless you have defined different ones in the default LDAP settings for the platform (<span class="uicontrol">Manage LDAP settings</span> menu option). </p>

      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To save your entries, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p id="OrgCreate__The_new_organization_is_creat_task_taskbody_result_p">The organization is created with the specified administrator account. The administrator is notified by email that his account has been created. The email contains the URL for accessing the platform or the marketplace, as well as a user ID and password for the first login. </p>

      <p>If the administrator's organization uses an external authentication system:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <ul>
          <li>Passwords are managed in this system. Therefore, the administrator is sent an email without a password. The password stored in the external authentication system must be used for logging in.</li>

          <li>If the user ID of the administrator already exists in the platform, his email address (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@organization.com</samp>) is used as user ID for logging in to the system. If yet another organization is created and the user ID of the administrator is again identical, the new user ID is constructed using the existing ID followed by the "at" sign (@) and the ID of the administrator's  organization (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@abcdefg</samp>). The administrator is sent an email with the respective user ID.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>The default organizational unit of the organization is also created. The administrator is the first member of this default unit. Any user who will be registered for the organization is automatically added to the default unit. Additional units can be created by the administrators of the organization.</p>
