  <h1 class="topictitle1">Managing organizations</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage organization</span> page, you can perform the following tasks:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <ul>
          <li class="liexpand">Add another <strong>role</strong> to the organization (technology provider, supplier, reseller, broker)</li>

          <li class="liexpand"><strong>Update</strong> the address and contact <strong>data</strong> of the organization. </li>

          <li class="liexpand">Set the <strong>Distinguished name</strong> for an organization.<p>This is required if the organization wants to use certificates for trusted communication between the organization itself and the platform operator organization.</p>
<p>The platform checks the distinguished name in a client's certificate. If it matches the one specified here, the caller is assumed to be authorized to connect to the platform. </p>
<p>You can retrieve the distinguished name of an organization from its certificate with the following call in your Java runtime environment: </p>
<div class="p">
              <pre class="codeblock">&lt;YourJRE&gt;/bin/keytool -printcert -file &lt;filename.crt&gt;</pre>

            </div>
<p>The process of integrating certificates is described in detail in the <em>Operator's Guide</em>.</p>
</li>

          <li class="liexpand">If the platform is installed in SAML_SP authentication mode, change or associate a <strong>tenant</strong> with the organization. <p>By assigning a tenant to an organization, the emails sent to the users of the organization will contain the URL of a marketplace or an administration portal of this tenant. Tenants must have been created beforehand on the <strong>Manage tenants</strong> page. The <strong>Marketplace</strong> drop-down list then offers all marketplaces associated with the tenant. </p>
<p>If you leave this field empty, the URL will point to the default tenant.</p>
</li>

          <li class="liexpand">Define the <strong>payment types</strong> that a supplier or reseller organization may offer to its customers for services applying the platform's native billing system.<p>By default, suppliers and resellers can allow customers to pay on invoice so that they can subscribe to a service that is not free of charge. </p>
<p id="task634__PayTypes2">If a supplier or reseller requests a payment type other than on invoice, he must use the services of a commercial PSP. </p>
The process of integrating PSP support is described in detail in the <em>Operator's Guide</em>. </li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p><strong>To manage an organization</strong>:</p>

          <p>The list contains all organizations managed on your platform. </p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Edit the data as required: </span>

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Email</span>. Email address for general communication with the organization. The organization can later specify a separate email address to which invoices can be sent.<p>The system checks whether the syntax of the given email address is valid, and whether the domain name corresponds to the standards as defined and maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). </p>
<p>Examples: <samp class="codeph">user.name@domain.arpa</samp>, <samp class="codeph">user.name@domain.org</samp>, <samp class="codeph">user@mycompany.lan.uk</samp></p>
</li>

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Phone</span>. Telephone or mobile number of a contact person in the organization.</li>

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Website</span>. URL of the organization's website. This website can be accessed by customers when displaying details of the organization that offers a service they want to subscribe to. </li>

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Address</span> of the organization. The organization's administrator can later specify a different address to be printed on invoices.</li>

                </div>
</li>

            <li>For a supplier organization: <strong>Default operator rev. share (%)</strong>. This is the revenue share agreed between the operator and the supplier, which the operator is to receive from the supplier for selling services on the marketplaces managed on the operator's platform. The default operator revenue share applies to all services offered by the supplier as long as you do not define a service-specific revenue share using the <strong>Manage operator revenue share</strong> menu option in the <strong>Operation</strong> menu. It also applies irrespective of whether the supplier sells his services himself, or uses brokers or resellers for selling them. Discounts granted by a supplier to his customers are deducted from the revenue share. <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Revenue shares and discounts are calculated only for services applying the <span>platform's </span>native billing system. Services using an external billing system are not included in the calculation. </div>
</li>

            <li>For a technology provider, supplier, reseller, and/or broker organization:<p><span class="uicontrol">Profile image</span>: Image used on a marketplace. The profile image is shown as soon as a customer requests details of a service provided by this organization. </p>

         By assigning a tenant to an organization, the emails sent to the users of the organization will contain the URL of a marketplace or an administration portal of this tenant. <p>Updating the tenant can be used to remove an organization from a tenant, or to associate an organization with another tenant. </p>
<div class="p">
            <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you associate a different tenant, the IdP administrator must ensure that all users of this organization are properly configured in the IdP system.
