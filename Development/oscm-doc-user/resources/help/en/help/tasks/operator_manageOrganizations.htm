  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage organization</span> page, you can perform the following tasks:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <ul>
          <li class="liexpand">Add another <strong>role</strong> to the organization (technology provider, supplier, reseller, broker)</li>

          <li class="liexpand"><strong>Update</strong> the address and contact <strong>data</strong> of the organization. </li>

          <li class="liexpand">Set the <strong>Distinguished name</strong> for an organization.<p>This is required if the organization wants to use certificates for trusted communication between the organization itself and the platform operator organization.</p>
<p>The platform checks the distinguished name in a client's certificate. If it matches the one specified here, the caller is assumed to be authorized to connect to the platform. </p>
<p>You can retrieve the distinguished name of an organization from its certificate with the following call in your Java runtime environment: </p>
<div class="p">
              <pre class="codeblock">&lt;YourJRE&gt;/bin/keytool -printcert -file &lt;filename.crt&gt;</pre>

            </div>
<p>The process of integrating certificates is described in detail in the <em>Operator's Guide</em>.</p>
</li>

          <li class="liexpand">Define the <strong>payment types</strong> that a supplier or reseller organization may offer to its customers for services applying the platform's billing system.<p>By default, suppliers and resellers can allow customers to pay on invoice so that they can subscribe to a service that is not free of charge. </p>

It also applies irrespective of whether the supplier sells his services himself, or uses brokers or resellers for selling them.
