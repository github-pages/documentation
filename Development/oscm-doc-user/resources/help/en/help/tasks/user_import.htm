    <div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Import users</span> page, you can import users from an external LDAP system and thus register them. In addition, you can define their user roles. The LDAP system is used for authenticating the users when they log in. </p>

            <p>Upon creation or registration of your organization, LDAP-based authentication must have been specified and LDAP connection settings must have been defined.</p>

            <div class="p">The role of your organization determines which roles can be assigned to the users. The user roles control the actions a user is allowed to execute:<ul>
                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Standard user</strong>: Users with this non-privileged role can work with services their organization has subscribed to.</span> Every user registered with the platform automatically is a standard user. <span>Additional user roles must be assigned explicitly by an administrator.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Administrator</strong>: Each organization must have at least one user with this role. <span id="task634__d1902e90">An administrator can manage the organization's account and subscriptions as well as its users and their roles. The first administrator of an organization is defined when the organization is created.</span></span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Subscription manager</strong>: This role allows a user to subscribe to services and manage his own subscriptions. Unlike administrators, subscription managers are not permitted to work on subscriptions belonging to others or on subscription data related to billing and payment.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Technology manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define technical services. It can be assigned to users of technology provider organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Service manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define marketable services and price models as well as publish marketable services. It can be assigned to users of supplier organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Reseller</strong>: This role allows a user to publish a supplier's marketable services applying different terms and conditions. It can be assigned to users of reseller organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Broker</strong>: This role allows a user to publish a supplier's marketable services without changing the terms and conditions defined by the supplier. It can be assigned to users of broker organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Marketplace manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define the organizations who are allowed to publish services to a marketplace as well as update and customize a marketplace. This role can be assigned to users of marketplace owner organizations. It is automatically assigned to all administrators of the marketplace owner organization when a marketplace is created.</span></li>

                </ul>

            <p><strong>To import users from an external LDAP system</strong>:</p>

        </div>

        <ol><li class="stepexpand">
                <span>Identify the users you want to import.</span>
                 
                 You can use the following filter criteria: <div class="p">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="liexpand">Wildcard (*): All users existing in the LDAP system are listed. Be aware that a maximum of 100 users can be listed. Use more specific filter criteria, if necessary, for example, the starting character of user IDs together with a wildcard. </li>

                            <li class="liexpand">Characters and wildcards (*): All users are listed whose user ID matches the specified characters. For example, if you enter <samp class="codeph">*o*</samp>, all users whose user ID contains the character <samp class="codeph">o</samp> are listed. </li>

                            <li class="liexpand">User ID: To import one specific user, enter his ID directly. </li>

                        </ul>

                    </div>
<p>To list all users matching the filter criteria, click <span class="uicontrol">Search</span>.</p>

            </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
                <span>Select the check boxes for the users you want to import. </span>
                 If the LDAP attribute from which the email address of a user is read is not mapped to a corresponding value, you have to enter the email addresses of the respective users manually. 
            </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
                <span>Assign the required role to the user by selecting the corresponding check box.</span>
                 
                    <p>The available user roles depend on the role of your organization. If you do not select any check box, the user is automatically assigned the role of a standard user. </p>

                
            </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
                <span>To start the import, click <span class="uicontrol">Import</span>.</span>
            </li>
</ol>

        <div class="section">
            <p>The selected users are imported and registered. After a successful import and registration, the users are sent an email with the URL for accessing the system. They are automatically added to your organization's default organizational unit. The default organizational unit contains all users currently registered for your organization.</p>

            <p>If the user ID of a user to be imported already exists in the platform, the email address of this user (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@organization.com</samp>) is used as user ID for logging in to the system. If yet another user with the same ID is imported, the new user ID is constructed using the existing ID followed by the "at" sign (@) and the ID of the organization the user belongs to (e.g. <samp class="codeph">userSmith@abcdefg</samp>). The user is sent an email with the respective user ID.</p>

            <p>User data maintained in the external LDAP system such as the password, first name, or last name can only be changed in the external LDAP system. If the data is changed, the platform automatically synchronizes it. Be aware that an automatic synchronization is not possible in case a user ID is changed in the LDAP system. The user has to be imported again.</p>
