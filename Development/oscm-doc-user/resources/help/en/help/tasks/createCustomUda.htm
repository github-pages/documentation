  <h1 class="topictitle1">Adding a custom attribute</h1>

  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Add custom attribute</span> page, you can add a custom attribute for your customers or for your subscriptions, respectively. </p>

      <p><strong>To add a custom attribute</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Type an identifier or name for the attribute in the <span class="uicontrol">Attribute ID</span> field. </span>
         Attribute IDs are restricted to 40 characters and must not contain any of the following characters: <p><samp class="codeph">! " # $ % &amp; ' * + , / : ; &lt; &gt; \ ^ `</samp></p>

      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>If you want to offer the custom attribute with a name translated into one of the supported languages:</span>
         Select the <span class="uicontrol">Language</span> in which the attribute is to be displayed, and enter a name for it in the <span class="uicontrol">Attribute name</span> entry field.<p>You can enter a maximum of 255 characters.</p>

      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Enter a default value for the attribute in the <span class="uicontrol">Default value</span> field.</span>
         
          <p>You can enter a maximum of 255 characters.</p>

          <p>The default value is used as long as no specific value for an individual customer or an individual subscription is entered. If the value for an attribute for subscriptions is to be specified by the customer (see step 3 below), the corresponding field is preset with this default value during the subscription process. If the value for an attribute for customers is to be specified by the customer administrator, the corresponding field is preset with this default value when editing the organization's profile on the <strong>Service data</strong> page. </p>

        
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">User option</span> check box if the attribute is to be offered to a customer's administrator or subscription manager when he subscribes to one of your services (in case of a subscription-specific attribute), or to a customer administrator when editing the organization's profile. This allows the administrator or subscription manager to enter a value for the attribute.</span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Mandatory</span> check box if you want to make the specification of the attribute value mandatory.</span>
         The check box is only available if you selected <span class="uicontrol">User option</span> in step 3 above.
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>If your customers use an IaaS service such as OpenStack or Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can enter the ID of the corresponding service controller in the <span class="uicontrol">Controller ID</span> field. Contact your technology provider for details. By specifying a controller ID, you can allow your customers to set his credentials for an IaaS service without having to maintain these credentials for each subscription separately. </span>
         Be aware of the following if you want to offer this feature to your customers:<div class="p">
            <ul>
              <li>You need to define a custom attribute for customers. </li>

              <li>The attribute ID must match the corresponding setting in the service controller configuration settings. <p>For example, for OpenStack services you can create two custom attributes with the following IDs: <samp class="codeph">API_USER_NAME</samp> and <samp class="codeph">API_USER_PWD</samp>. For AWS, the IDs are <samp class="codeph">ACCESS_KEY_ID_PWD</samp> and <samp class="codeph">SECRET_KEY_PWD</samp>.</p>
</li>

              <li>
                <p>For the attributes used for entering passwords, select the <span class="uicontrol">Encrypted</span> check box so that passwords are encrypted when stored in the database as well as in reports and log files, and so that they are hidden on the user interface. </p>

              </li>

              <li>The customer administrator will be able to set the credentials for his organization in the IaaS provider when editing the organization's profile on his marketplace. Whenever the customer administrator changes the credentials, they are applied to all subscriptions of this customer.</li>

            </ul>

          </div>

      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Encrypted</span> check box if you want to encrypt the value of the custom attribute when stored in the database, as well as in log files and reports. In addition, any value the customer administrator enters in a field for an encrypted attribute will be hidden.</span>
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>To save your entries, click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span>
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p>You are returned to the page for managing custom attributes. The new custom attribute is instantly displayed. </p>

      <p>The name of the new attribute and its value will be included in the billing data for customers the next time the data is generated. If no value is specified for an attribute, the attribute name will be inserted into the billing data without a value.</p>
