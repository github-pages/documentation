            <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage service</span> page, you can view and update the details of the services which you are authorized to sell.</p>

            <p>The following information on a service is available:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="liexpand">The service name and short description which are shown in the service catalog on a marketplace when you activate the service.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">The service description which offers details of the features offered by the service. It is displayed on a marketplace when customers request details of the service.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">The license agreement which must be read and accepted by customers when they subscribe to the service.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">The details of the price model defined by the supplier of the service: <ul>
                        <li class="liexpand">If an external billing system is used for calculating the charges for the service, you can view the charging conditions and prices as defined in this system in a separate window by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Display</span>.</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">If the platform's native billing system is used, the service can be free of charge or with costs. If customers are charged for using the service, the charging conditions and prices are shown.<span> Click <a href="service_viewPMDetails.htm">here</a> for more details.</span> All prices are without VAT. </li>

                    </ul>
</li>

            </ul>

            <p>The information can only be viewed, except for the license agreement. You can update the text for your customers, if required. As a prerequisite, the service must be deactivated. Existing subscriptions of your customers are not affected by the update. Any changes you make are effective for new subscriptions only. To provide the service to customers for subscription, you must activate it.</p>

            <p><strong>To view and update the details of a service</strong>:</p>
