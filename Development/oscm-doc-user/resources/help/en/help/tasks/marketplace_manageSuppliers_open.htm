        <span>On the <span class="uicontrol">Manage sellers</span> page, you can decide who is allowed to publish services to a marketplace.</span>
      </p>

      <p>You have selected an open marketplace. This means that basically any supplier, broker, and reseller organization can publish services to it.</p>

      <p>As the marketplace owner, however, you can at any time explicitly exclude one or more sellers and add them to a blacklist. This might be required, for example, if a seller is in arrears with his payments. If the seller already published services to the marketplace, these services are automatically deactivated. Customers can no longer subscribe to them. Existing subscriptions are not affected. The <span class="uicontrol">Manage sellers</span> page lists all sellers that are currently excluded.</p>

      <p>You can allow a seller who has been excluded from the marketplace to publish services again at any time, for example if he is not in arrears with his payments any longer.</p>

      <p>When you exclude a seller or when you allow an excluded seller to publish services again, the administrators of the seller organization are automatically notified by email.</p>

      <p><strong>To exclude a seller from the selected marketplace</strong>:</p>

    </div>

    <ol><li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Type the organization ID of the seller in the <span class="uicontrol">Organization ID</span> field.</span>
         Contact the seller to get his organization ID.
      </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
        <span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Exclude</span> and confirm the exclusion. </span>
         The exclusion takes effect immediately. The seller can no longer publish his services to the marketplace.
      </li>
</ol>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>To allow an excluded seller to publish services again</strong>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="liexpand">Select the check box next to the seller you want to allow to publish services again. <p>You can select one or several check boxes.</p>
</li>

        <li class="liexpand">Click <span class="uicontrol">Authorize</span>.<p>The authorization takes effect immediately. The seller can publish his services to the marketplace again.</p>
</li>
