    <h1 class="topictitle1">Registering new users</h1>

    <div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>On the <span class="uicontrol">Register new users</span> page, you can register new users for your organization and define their user roles. You can also register multiple users with the administrator and/or manager roles in one operation by importing a user data file. This is possible, if your organization does not use LDAP for user authentication. If your organization uses LDAP for user authentication, you can import them from the LDAP system using the <strong>Import users</strong> option and thus register them. </p>

            <div class="p">The role of your organization determines which roles can be assigned to the users. The user roles control the actions a user is allowed to execute:<ul>
                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Standard user</strong>: Users with this non-privileged role can work with services their organization has subscribed to.</span> Every user registered with the platform automatically is a standard user. <span>Additional user roles must be assigned explicitly by an administrator.</span>
                    </li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Administrator</strong>: Each organization must have at least one user with this role. <span id="task634__N500CF">An administrator can manage the organization's account and subscriptions as well as its users and their roles. The first administrator of an organization is defined when the organization is created.</span></span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>OU administrator</strong>: The users of an organization can be grouped in organizational units (OUs). The OU administrator role allows a user to manage the organizational units for which he has been appointed as an administrator, to create, modify, and terminate subscriptions for these units, as well as generate reports for cost-controlling purposes.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Subscription manager</strong>: This role allows a user to subscribe to services and manage his own subscriptions. Unlike administrators, subscription managers are not permitted to work on subscriptions belonging to others or on subscription data related to billing and payment.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Technology manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define technical services. It can be assigned to users of technology provider organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Service manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define marketable services and price models as well as publish marketable services. It can be assigned to users of supplier organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Reseller</strong>: This role allows a user to publish a supplier's marketable services applying different terms and conditions. It can be assigned to users of reseller organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Broker</strong>: This role allows a user to publish a supplier's marketable services without changing the terms and conditions defined by the supplier. It can be assigned to users of broker organizations.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Marketplace manager</strong>: This role allows a user to define the organizations who are permitted to access a marketplace and publish services to it as well as update and customize a marketplace. This role can be assigned to users of marketplace owner organizations. It is automatically assigned to all administrators of the marketplace owner organization when a marketplace is created.</span></li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span><strong>Operator</strong>: This role allows a user to carry out configuration and maintenance tasks, manage organizations, and create marketplaces.</span> The first operator is created together with its operator organization when the platform is installed.</li>
