    <h1 class="topictitle1"><span>User interface resources</span>
    </h1>

    <div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The user interface resources are translated or updated in a Microsoft Excel file generated with the <span class="uicontrol">Export</span> function on the <span class="uicontrol">Manage languages</span> page. </p>

            <p>The exported Microsoft Excel file contains three worksheets: </p>

            <div class="p">
                <ul>
                    <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">User interface</span>: All texts, labels, and messages that appear on the user interface of the platform's administration portal and the marketplaces.</li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Email</span>: The subject and body texts of all email messages which are generated automatically by the platform. </li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Platform objects</span>: The names of service parameters and events, report titles and names of payment types provided by the platform. The parameter and event names are visible to suppliers when defining a marketable service as well as to users subscribing to a service.</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

            <p> </p>

            <p>Each worksheet contains five columns: </p>

            <div class="p">
                <ul>
                    <li class="liexpand"><span class="uicontrol">Key</span> used by the platform to identify the label or string. The keys must not be changed. </li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><strong>de system</strong>, <strong>en system</strong>, <strong>ja system</strong>: The system default names and labels provided with the language bundles after installation (German, English, Japanese). The system default strings are for your reference when providing translations.</li>

                    <li class="liexpand"><strong>Add your language code here</strong> or <strong><em>&lt;Language Code&gt;</em></strong>: In this column, the strings of the new language to be supported are to be entered. <p><strong>Add your language code here</strong> is shown if you did not select a language on the <strong>Manage languages</strong> page before exporting the data. In this case, you usually want to provide a new language. The column is empty.</p>
<p>If you selected a language on the <strong>Manage languages</strong> page, the column is headed by the code of this language. In this case, you usually update existing translations of the selected language. You can also select the system default languages (de, en, or jp) if you want to customize the system default strings. </p>
<p>The strings can be also be changed by marketplace managers using the <span class="uicontrol">Marketplace</span> --&gt; <span class="uicontrol">Customize texts</span> menu function. Their changes apply to the marketplaces owned by the organization of the marketplace managers.</p>
</li>

                </ul>

            </div>

            <p>Proceed as follows to translate the file: </p>

            <div class="p">
                <ol>
                    <li class="liexpand"><strong>On the three worksheets</strong>, enter the ISO language code of the language you want to provide in the header of the fifth column. </li>

                    <li class="liexpand">For each key, enter your translation in the fifth column. <p>If a translation is missing, the English label or string is used. If the English label or string is not defined either, the language-independent technical key is displayed. </p>
<p>Be aware of the following: </p>
<ul>
                            <li class="liexpand">You can use HTML markups in the texts for all keys which represent a descriptive text (keys ending with <samp class="codeph">.description</samp>). For example, you can use <samp class="codeph">&lt;b&gt;</samp> for bold text, <samp class="codeph">&lt;br&gt;</samp> for line breaks, and so on. </li>

                            <li class="liexpand">You can use the complete Unicode character set. </li>

                            
                            
                            <li class="liexpand">You can remove the text from the table cells which you do not want to change. This may be useful for managing and tracking your changes to the user interface.</li>

                            <li class="liexpand">You must make sure that HTML fields contain valid data and do not break the page layout. For example, text which is too long will be broken into multiple lines on the user interface. Use a separate test environment for testing your translations. </li>

                        </ul>
</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Save the Microsoft Excel file in <samp class="codeph">.xls</samp> format.</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">Import the file on the <strong>Manage languages</strong> page. <p>By importing the file, existing labels and strings in the language with the code entered in the fifth column are overwritten. The language can be used instantly after its activation. Users who have set the language in their profile will instantly see your customizations.</p>

                            <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Make sure that all cells on all worksheets of the Excel file are formatted as text.</div>

                        </div>
