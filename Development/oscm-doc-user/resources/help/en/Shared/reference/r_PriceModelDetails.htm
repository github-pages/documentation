                    <li class="liexpand">A <strong>customer price model</strong> is specific to one customer and to one service that is used by the customer. It is not available for any other services offered to the same or a different customer. When you define a customer price model, a separate marketable service is automatically created for this specific customer only.<p>A customer price model can be used, for example, to offer lower charges to a long-time customer, or to make a new service available to a pilot customer at no charge.</p>
</li>

                    <li class="liexpand">A <strong>subscription price model</strong> is specific to one subscription of an individual customer. It is not available for any other subscriptions of the same or a different customer. As soon as the subscription terminates, the price model is automatically outdated. </li>

            </div>

            <p>The service price model defines the prices to which brokers and resellers are bound if they offer and sell a service.</p>
