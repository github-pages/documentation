            <p>The operator can view and export audit log data on all kinds of user operations related to subscriptions and marketable services including their price models. This may be useful, for example, to check when and by whom a price model was changed, when subscriptions were created, when and by whom a license description was changed.</p>

            <p>Single entries of the audit log consist of a <strong>header</strong> and a <strong>message</strong>, separated by a comma. </p>

            <p>The header consists of the following elements, separated by a blank:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><samp class="codeph">MM/DD/YYYY_hh:mm:ss.SSS</samp>: The local server date and time.</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><samp class="codeph">FSP_SW/CT-MG_CTMG-BSS</samp>: The predefined log label for log entries resulting from user operations on your platform. This label cannot be changed.</p>

                </li>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><samp class="codeph">3&lt;<em>nnnn</em>&gt;</samp>: The ID of the operation that was logged. This is a number between 30000 and 39999. The ID is unique for each operation. For example, the ID of the <samp class="codeph">Define service</samp> operation is 30090, the ID of the <samp class="codeph">Subscribe to service</samp> operation is 30000. </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><samp class="codeph">&lt;<em>operation</em>&gt;</samp>: The operation that was logged, for example, <samp class="codeph">Define service</samp>. </p>

                </li>

            <p>Following the header, the detailed log message is appended. It consists of name-value pairs with additional information, separated by vertical bars (|).</p>

            <p>Every message starts with the following name-value pairs:</p>

                </li>

            </ul>

            <div class="p">The log entries are categorized by the role of the user who executed an operation: 
            
                <ul>
