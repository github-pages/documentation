    <div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Welcome to the sample for integrating an external billing system with <span>OSCM</span>. </p>

            <p>The sample consists of a file-based mock billing system and a billing adapter for its integration with <span>OSCM</span>. The billing system and adapter are ready to use, their source code is provided in addition.  You can use the sample to evaluate the retrieval of price models for services, customers, and subscriptions from an external billing system.</p>

            <p>The following sections provide an overview of the resources that make up the sample and a step-by-step description of how to deploy, configure, register, and use the billing system and adapter. For a general description of the steps and issues involved in integrating an external billing system with <span>OSCM</span>, refer to the <em>Developer's Guide</em>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Sample Resources</h4>
            
            <p>The following resources are provided in the <samp class="codeph">samples/billingPlugin</samp> folder:</p>

            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Deploying and Configuring the Billing System and Adapter</h4>
            
            <p>You can deploy the billing system and adapter on an application server of your choice. They have been developed and tested with Glassfish 3.1.2.2, which is thus recommended.</p>

            <p>Proceed as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="liexpand">Deploy the billing system, <samp class="codeph">oscm-file-billing.war</samp>, to a domain of your choice on the application server.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Deploy the billing adapter, <samp class="codeph">oscm-file-adapter.ear</samp>, to the same domain.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Configure the billing adapter in the following file in the application server domain to which you deployed it: <p><samp class="codeph">&lt;domain&gt;/applications/oscm-file-adapter/oscm-file-adapter_jar/billingApplication.properties</samp></p>
<p>The file contains the URLs of the billing system. In each of these URLs, change the host name and port to the ones of your installation, for example: </p>
<p><samp class="codeph">priceModelURL=http://<strong>myhost:8680</strong>/oscm-file-billing/rest/priceModel</samp></p>
<p>Save the changed configuration file.</p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Reload the billing adapter application using the means of your application server.</li>

            </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Registering the Billing Adapter</h4>
            
            <p>The billing adapter must be registered in the <span>OSCM</span> installation with which you want to use it. This is the task of the installation's operator. </p>

            <p>As the provider of the billing adapter, you are responsible for ensuring the communication with <span>OSCM</span>. This may, for example, involve the appropriate configuration of firewalls and access paths.</p>

            <p>To register the billing adapter:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="liexpand">Log in to the <span>OSCM</span> administration portal as a platform operator.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Using the <span class="uicontrol">Manage billing systems</span> in the <span class="uicontrol">Operation</span> menu, add a new billing system. Specify the following information:

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Using the Billing System and Adapter</h4>
            
            <p>With a successful configuration and connection between <span>OSCM</span> and the billing adapter, you can specify the billing system for technical services and obtain price models from it for marketable services, customers, and subscriptions based on these technical services.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Technical Services</h4>
            
            <p>In order to use the sample billing system and adapter for a technical service, you need to specify the billing system ID with which it was registered in the technical service definition XML in the <samp class="codeph">billingIdentifier</samp> attribute of the top <samp class="codeph">TechnicalService</samp> element. </p>

            <p>The billing sample comes with a technical service definition, <samp class="codeph">TechnicalService_ExternalBilling.xml</samp>, which you can use for practicing with external price models. The predefined <samp class="codeph">billingIdentifier</samp> in the sample is <samp class="codeph">FILE_BILLING</samp>, but you can change it as required. Several parameters are defined for the technical service, based on which different price models can be retrieved.</p>

            <p>For practicing, register the technical service in <span>OSCM</span>:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="liexpand">Log in to the <span>OSCM</span> administration portal as a technology manager of a technology provider organization.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Using the <span class="uicontrol">Import service definition</span> option in the <span class="uicontrol">Technical service</span> menu, import the XML file containing the service definition.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Using the <span class="uicontrol">Manage suppliers</span> option in the <span class="uicontrol">Account</span> menu, appoint a supplier for the new technical service.</li>

            </ol>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Price Models</h4>
            
            <p>As a service manager of an authorized supplier organization, you can define price models for marketable services, specific customers, and subscriptions based on the technical service with the billing system configured. You do this using the corresponding options at the <span>OSCM</span> administration portal. Upon each import request for a price model from the billing system, the billing adapter returns a PDF file with the appropriate contents matching the context in <span>OSCM</span>.</p>

            <p>The predefined price model PDF files of the sample are available in language-specific subfolders of the following folder in the application server domain to which you deployed the billing system and adapter: </p>

            <p><samp class="codeph">&lt;domain&gt;/applications/oscm-file-billing/WEB-INF/classes/pm</samp></p>

            <p>The decision which price model to return to <span>OSCM</span> is made based on the entries in the following files in the same folder: </p>

            <ul>
                <li class="liexpand"><samp class="codeph">ServicePriceModel.csv</samp> - for service price models and customer-specific price models</li>

                <li class="liexpand"><samp class="codeph">SubscriptionPriceModel.csv</samp> - for subscription price models</li>

            </ul>

            <p>In both files, the <samp class="codeph">UUID</samp>, <samp class="codeph">FileType</samp>, and <samp class="codeph">FileName</samp> columns specify the price model to be returned. <samp class="codeph">UUID</samp> is a unique ID, <samp class="codeph">FileType</samp> the type of the price model file, <samp class="codeph">FileName</samp> the path and name of the file. The <samp class="codeph">Tag</samp> column in the <samp class="codeph">ServicePriceModel.csv</samp> file specifies a string to be returned to <span>OSCM</span> together with the price model for display in the service details.</p>

            <p>The remaining columns of the <samp class="codeph">.csv</samp> files specify the locale and the <span>OSCM</span> context for which a price model is to be returned. For subscriptions, this the subscription ID. For services, it is the combination of service parameters (<samp class="codeph">INSTANCE</samp>, <samp class="codeph">REGION</samp>, <samp class="codeph">OS</samp>). The customer ID is evaluated for customer-specific price models.</p>

            <p><strong>Examples: </strong></p>

            <p>For a service with the parameter values<samp class="codeph"> t2.micro</samp> for <samp class="codeph">INSTANCE</samp>, <samp class="codeph">eu-west-1</samp> for <samp class="codeph">REGION</samp>, and <samp class="codeph">linux</samp> for <samp class="codeph">OS</samp>, the language-specific price model <samp class="codeph">t2_micro_eu_frankfurt_linux.pdf</samp> and the tag <samp class="codeph">Starting at 4.97 $/Month</samp> are returned. </p>

            <p>For a subscription named <samp class="codeph">Trial Subscription</samp>, the language-specific price model <samp class="codeph">trial_subscription.pdf</samp> is returned.</p>

            <p><strong>Be aware of the following:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li class="liexpand">The service parameter values in the <samp class="codeph">ServicePriceModel.csv</samp> file must match the ones defined in the technical service definition. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">The predefined parameter value combinations in the <samp class="codeph">ServicePriceModel.csv</samp> file are not complete. You may want to add further combinations. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">The same applies to the predefined price models. You can at any time add PDF files in the language-specific folders.</li>

                <li class="liexpand">In order to obtain customer-specific price models in <span>OSCM</span>, you need to insert the correct customer ID in the <samp class="codeph">ServicePriceModel.csv</samp> file.</li>

            </ul>
