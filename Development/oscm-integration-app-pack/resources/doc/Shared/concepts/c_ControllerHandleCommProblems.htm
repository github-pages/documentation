            <h1 class="topictitle1">Handling Communication Problems Between APP and <span>OSCM</span></h1>

            <div>
                        <div class="section">
            <p>When the communication between APP and <span>OSCM</span> is no longer possible, for example, because <span>OSCM</span> is stopped, APP suspends the processing of requests. An internal flag is set in the APP database: <samp class="codeph">APP_SUSPEND=true</samp>, and an email is sent to the address specified in the <samp class="codeph">APP_ADMIN_MAIL_ADDRESS</samp> configuration setting.</p>

            <p>Contact the <span>OSCM</span> operator to make sure that <span>OSCM</span> is up and running again correctly. </p>

            <p>You then have the following possibilities to resume the processing of requests by APP: </p>

            <ol>
                <li class="liexpand">Click the link provided in the email. </li>

                <li class="liexpand">Log in to APP. <p>APP is restarted instantly. In the APP database, the <samp class="codeph">APP_SUSPEND</samp> key is set to <samp class="codeph">false</samp>. </p>
</li>

            </ol>

            <p>As an alternative, you can proceed as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li class="liexpand">In a Web browser, access the Web interface (base URL) of APP.<p>The access URL has the following format: </p>
<p><samp class="codeph">https://&lt;hostname.fqdn&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/oscm-app</samp></p>
<p><samp class="codeph">&lt;hostname.fqdn&gt;</samp> is the name and the fully qualified domain name of the machine where the <samp class="codeph">oscm-app</samp> container has been deployed, <samp class="codeph">&lt;port&gt;</samp> is the port to address the machine (default <samp class="codeph">8881</samp>), <samp class="codeph">oscm-app</samp> is the default context root of APP and cannot be changed. </p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Log in with the ID and password of the user and organization defined by the platform operator in the <samp class="codeph">BSS_USER_ID</samp> and <samp class="codeph">BSS_USER_PWD</samp> configuration settings (default: <samp class="codeph">administrator</samp>, <samp class="codeph">admin123</samp>).<p>A message is shown that APP has been suspended due to a communication problem with <span>OSCM</span>. </p>
</li>

                <li class="liexpand">Click <strong>Restart</strong>.<p>APP is restarted instantly. In the APP database, the <samp class="codeph">APP_SUSPEND</samp> key is set to <samp class="codeph">false</samp>. </p>
</li>

            </ol>
